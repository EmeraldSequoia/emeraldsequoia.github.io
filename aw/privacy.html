  <h2>General policy for all products</h2>

<p>
Emerald Sequoia LLC takes privacy very seriously.
<p>
  We do not send any information of any kind to our servers or anyone
  else's servers.  All calculations, including those that use user
  location, are done on-device without the need to send your location
  or other data to a server.
<p>
  We store the last location we got from the OS on your device, to
  more quickly start up with the correct astronomical displays.  No
  other history of device location is stored.
<p>
  We keep email that you send to us, so we can track bugs and so that
  we can occasionally let you know if a feature you've requested has
  been implemented or a bug you've reported has been fixed.  We never
  send other unsolicited email and we will never sell or give away your
  email address to another company.
<p>
  If you register your email address with our 
  <a href="../esblog/">blog</a>, and sign up for notifications
  when new blog entries are posted, that email is used only for that purpose and
  will not be used in any other way.

  <h2><a href="index.html">Emerald&nbsp;Chronometer for Wear&nbsp;OS</a></h2>
<p>
  We follow all of the privacy notes listed above in the general section.
<p>
  We store per-face settings, such as which cities appear in <a href="terra/terra_i.html">Terra</a>
  and <a href="terra/gaia_i.html">Gaia</a>, again only on the device.
<hr size=1>
  <h2>Products for Apple&nbsp;iOS (iPhone and iPad)</h2>
<p>
  We follow all of the privacy notes listed above in the general section.
<p>
  <a href="../h/index.html">Emerald Chronometer for iOS</a> and 
  <a href="../eg/index.html">Emerald Geneva for iOS</a> store your user settings, including a history of the
  locations you've previously used to override the device location; this history
  is again stored only on the device and we never send it anywhere.
<p>
  <a href="../ts/index.html">Emerald Timestamp for iOS</a> stores the events you have recorded on the device, along with
  any descriptions you have entered.  We never transfer those events to any
  server, except if you explicitly request to email them, and then only to the
  email address you specify.
<p>
  <a href="../eo/index.html">Emerald Observatory for the iPad</a> stores your user settings, including the overridden location
  if you've set one, again only on the device.
<p>
  <a href="../et/index.html">Emerald Time for iOS</a> stores your user settings, including which NTP time server you've
  specified, again only on the device.
