<dt> It crashes on the new iPad!
</dt>
<dd> This bug is fixed in version 3.7.3 of Emerald Chronometer HD, which was released in the store on March 13, 2012.  The crash only occurs on the new iPad with Retina display.
<p>
If you see a problem and you are running ECHD 3.7.3, please let us know immediately at <a href="mailto:essupport@emeraldsequoia.com?subject=Emerald%20Chronometer">essupport@emeraldsequoia.com</a>.
<p>
</dd>

<dt> What's the difference between Emerald Chronometer and Emerald Chronometer HD?
</dt>
<dd> 
<ul>
<li>ECHD is for the iPad; EC is for the iPhone and iPod touch.
<li>ECHD runs only on iPad<span style="font-size:6pt; vertical-align: super">Â®</span>.  EC runs on all iOS devices but on iPads it runs in emulation mode only.
<li>ECHD's options pages have been reformatted for the larger screen (though their function remains the same).
<li>ECHD runs in both landscape and portrait orientations.
</ul>
</dd>

<dt> The buttons at the bottom left and right don't work for me, although swiping left and right works fine.
</dt>
<dd> We've had a few reports of this problem, all from customers running older versions of iOS (typically iOS 4.2.1).  We have heard from them that upgrading to iOS 4.3.3 fixes the problem.  (iPads that we own are all at iOS 4.3.x already and we've been unable to reproduce the problem with the simulator running an older version).
<p>
If you see this problem and you *are* running iOS 4.3.x, please let us know immediately at <a href="mailto:essupport@emeraldsequoia.com?subject=Emerald%20Chronometer">essupport@emeraldsequoia.com</a>.
<p>
</dd>

<dt> How come I have to pay again for the iPad version if I already have Emerald Chronometer?
</dt>
<dd> The iPad version was a significant amount of work for us. For more details, see <a href="http://emeraldsequoia.com/esblog/2011/05/07/emerald-chronometer-hd-and-ec-price-reduction/">our blog entry about this</a>.

<dt>That's an awfully short FAQ.  I have more questions.
