Thanks for looking in on us.

We've created this blog so that we can communicate to our customers; Apple does not provide us with any customer email addresses, so this is the best mechanism we have come up with.

We're not sure what the volume will be until we get going.  But there will be occasional, perhaps weekly or monthly, posts that

- let you know what the developers have been doing lately
- possibly ask for feature or design feedback
- announce new products or new versions of products

and more sporadically

- expound philosophically on the experience of being an iPad/iPhone/iPad touch developer.

We welcome feedback of all kinds.  Well, maybe not _all_ kinds; please keep it civil.  :-)

Thanks for participating.

\- Steve
