We've settled on November 1, 2023 as the date our apps will be removed from the stores (see [our post about it](https://emeraldsequoia.com/esblog/2022/12/21/emerald-sequoias-future/)). We will continue to respond to support requests through December 31 but will be unable to help you if an app has been removed from your device.
