We've just added our 16th watch to Emerald Chronometer and Emerald Chronometer HD: "Babylon" is a full-month calendar watch, with an unusual mechanism.

The mechanism (which is one of our most complicated "mechanically") consists of three stacked wheels and a series of covers that slide in and out. You can read more about it [here](http://emeraldsequoia.com/h/Babylon/Babylon.html).

We hope you enjoy it!
