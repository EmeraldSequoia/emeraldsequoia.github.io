Just a quick note that there is a total lunar eclipse today: [http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/LEdecade/LEdecade2011.html](http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/LEdecade/LEdecade2011.html)  
[http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/LEplot/LEplot2001/LE2011Jun15T.pdf](http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/LEplot/LEplot2001/LE2011Jun15T.pdf)

It's the longest and deepest lunar eclipse of the decade, but unfortunately most of our customers will miss it because the moon will be below the horizon. You'll be able to see a bit of the ends in Europe and Australia, but only India and eastern Africa (and a bit of central Asia) will get the whole show.

You can still see the effects in Emerald Observatory and Emerald Chronometer/Emerald Geneva (the back of the Geneva watch has an eclipse indicator dial), even if the eclipse isn't visible at your location.
