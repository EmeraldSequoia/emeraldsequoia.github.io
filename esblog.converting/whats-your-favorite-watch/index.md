OK, first feedback question:  What's your favorite watch in Emerald Chronometer?  Submit your answer via the comments (click on the Comments link to the upper right of this post; you'll have to register the first time you comment but it's free).

My personal favorite tends to change depending on what I'm working on.  For a while my favorite was Miami, because, odd as it is, the front side can tell you a lot of stuff about what's going on in the sky (it might be worth a separate posting at some point; you can use it to find planets in the sky and even quickly estimate the phase of the moon).  But Geneva, because of its zillion complications, will probably always be the one I keep coming back to.
