<h3>FAQ</h3>
<dl>

<dt> I'm seeing crashes (Emerald Geneva just abruptly disappears).
</dt>
<dd>If you see a crash with the latest versions of Emerald Geneva and iPhone OS, and you're not running a jailbroken phone (see below), PLEASE report it to the email address below.
<p>
</dd>

<dt> Will it work on an iPod<span style="font-size:6pt; vertical-align: super">Â®</span> touch?
</dt>
<dd> Yes.  But see <a href="../h/Settings.html">here</a> for more about setting your time and location correctly.
<p>
</dd>

<dt> Will Emerald Geneva work without an Internet connection (eg. out in the 
wilderness where even cell phone service is unavailable)?
</dt>
<dd>Yes.  Time and location are all that we need;
 all of the astronomy calculations are done
 internally with no Internet required.
See
<a href="../h/Settings.html">here</a> for more about setting your time and location correctly.
<p>
</dd>

<dt>The sunrise/sunset times are wrong on my iPod touch.
</dt>
<dd>You may need to enter your latitude and longitude manually. 
You do this via the Settings panel which is accessed from the "gear" button in the lower right corner of the screen.
  See <a href="../h/Settings.html">here</a> for more details.
<p>
</dd>

<dt> Will it work on a jailbroken iPhone?
</dt>
<dd> Probably not.  We don't support that configuration and we've had reports of odd problems.
<p>
</dd>

<dt> What's all this about "complications"?  What's so complicated about a little calculation?
</dt>
<dd> Well, the calculations are actually pretty complex.  But "complication" is a term of art in the horology (fancy watch) world.  It refers to any watch display other than
hours, minutes, and seconds (or sometimes simple day/date).  See:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(horology)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(horology)<img src="extlink.png"></a><br>
Emerald Geneva has a very large number of complications; <a href="Complications.html">here's a list</a>.
<p>
</dd>

<dt> I leave my iPhone in its dock to charge and love to see Geneva all of the time.
  But how can I do that without disabling Auto-lock completely?
</dt>
<dd>
There are two Settings items that let you disable Auto-lock when running Emerald Geneva, either all of the time or only when plugged in.
Be careful; if the iPhone is not plugged in, leaving the display on can drain the battery
in just a few hours.
See <a href="../h/Settings.html">here</a> for more details.
<p>
</dd>

<dt> When I start up Emerald Geneva sometimes the hands jump just as the time synchronization indicator turns green.
</dt>
<dd> Yup.  Until we get the first reply from an NTP server we don't really know what the right time is.  It will be stable after that.
<P>
</dd>

<dt> My eyes aren't what the used to be and some of those dials and hands are awfully small.  Can you implement a zoom feature?
</dt>
<dd> The latest iPhone and iPod touch models have a way to do a zoom on any app.  Go to Settings=>General=>Accessibility and click on Zoom.  The zoom gestures are explained on that page.  If you don't find this setting, make sure you have the latest iPhone OS.
<P>
</dd>

<dt> Since I bought Emerald Geneva, I've started getting spam about watches!
</dt>
<dd>
Emerald Sequoia has not ever sold, nor will we ever sell, email addresses of our customers
 or of anyone else who contacts us via email.  We hate spam as much as you do.
<p>
</dd>

<dt> It sure would be nice if ...
</dt>
<dd> Don't hesitate to send us enchancement requests or ideas for new watches.
Some of the ideas we've gotten have been really interesting!
We're only a two-person company, so we can't promise if or when any particular request will be implemented.
But the more requests we get from our customers for a particular feature the higher its priority becomes.
Unless we think it's really cool and do it right away.
 <img src="../images/smile.png" alt="smiley" align=center />
<p>
</dd>

<dt> The iPhone isn't designed for the wrist!  How can I get the full experience of actually wearing a fine mechanical timepiece?
</dt>
<dd>If you're desperate, you could try <a href="emeraldwristwatch.html">this</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;But we don't recommend it. <img src="../images/smile.png" alt=":-)" align=center />
<p>
</dd>

<dt> I thought upgrades were free but the App Store seems to have no option other than "Buy Now".
</dt>
<dd> Yes, that's a bit odd.  But it really is free.  Just click the "$4.99" button and the "Buy Now" button and enter your password.  After a bit you'll see a message saying, "You have already purchased this item.  To download it again for free, select OK."
<P>
</dd>

<dt> I tried to upgrade to the latest version and got a message saying I needed to pay again. I thought the upgrades were free?
</dt>
<dd> This is most likely the result of a mix up in your iTunes configuration.
It probably doesn't recognize you as the one who bought the original version, perhaps 
because you  have more than one iTunes account.
<p>
It may also be that the account you used with the App Store app on your iPhone is not the same as the one
you're using with iTunes.  If so, and you don't want to change that,
 then just get the upgrade directly on your iPhone via the App Store application.
<p>
</dd>

<dt> I want my money back  &lt;for whatever reason&gt;
</dt>
<dd>
Unfortunately, Apple does not provide developers like us a way to refund or annul a purchase,
 as far as we've been able to discover.
One thing that may work, though, is to use the iTunes<span style="font-size:6pt; vertical-align: super">Â®</span> store feedback process described at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1933">http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1933<img src="extlink.png"></a>
<br>
One of the great benefits of the way Apple set up the iPhone application distribution system is that developers
don't have to get involved in the billing process.  One of the negatives is that we have no direct way
 to help even if we want to.

Emerald Geneva is a "Lite" version of our flagship iPhoneâ¢
app <a href="../h/index.html">Emerald Chronometer</a><sup>&#0174;</sup>.
<p>
Emerald Geneva contains only the single watch Geneva, the most complicated
of the 14 watches in Emerald Chronometer, and does not have (or need) the
mechanisms to switch between watches; but it is otherwise identical to
Emerald Chronometer's version of Geneva.  All of the supporting technology,
including NTP (atomic time), the highly accurate astronomical data from 4000
BCE to 2800 CE, and the ability to select locations and time zones in a
variety of ways, carry over from Emerald Chronometer unchanged.
<p>
Thus to learn about Emerald Geneva, you can read about:
<ul>
 <li><a href="../h/Geneva/Geneva.html">The specific hands and dials on the watch Geneva</a>
 <li><a href="../h/index.html">General Emerald Chronometer features</a>, keeping in mind that watches other than Geneva are not included in this app.

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<dl>

<dt> The alarm time gets messed up sometimes.
</dt>
<dd> This is a known problem in version 1.3.7.  The problem occurs when Observatory starts up and attempts to restore the alarm time from the previous session.   We are working on a fix.  In the meanwhile, the only workaround is to make sure Observatory is the foreground app with the correct alarm time set whenever you want to rely on the alarm.
<p>
Version 1.3.8 with a fix to this problem has been submitted to the App Store.
<p>
</dd>

<dt> Will it work on an iPhoneâ¢ or iPod<span style="font-size:6pt; vertical-align: super">Â®</span> touch?
</dt>
<dd> No.  But we're thinking about it...
<p>
</dd>

<dt> Will it work on a Mac or a PC or any other smart phone?
</dt>
<dd> No.
<p>
</dd>

<dt> Will Emerald Observatory work without an Internet connection?
</dt>
<dd>Yes. But the time may be somewhat inaccurate and you may have to set your location manually.
<p>
</dd>

<dt> The alarm doesn't work if Observatory is in the background or if the screen is locked (iOS 5 or later).
</dt>
<dd>Go to the Settings app, choose the Notifications item on the left side, and scroll down on the right side until you see "Observatory".
Tap on it and then turn on the switch for "Sounds".  That will allow the alarm sound to play even when Observatory is not active.
<p>
</dd>

<dt> The alarm is difficult (or impossible) to hear.
</dt>
<dd>There are several possibilities for this.  You can use the "Test" button on the Info page to assist in debugging.
<p>First, note that with the iOS 4.2 update, Apple changed the meaning of the hardware button near the volume keys; prior to 4.2, that button meant "lock orientation"; now it means "mute", as it does on the iPhone.  (Though a Setting to control which meaning is assigned was added in iOS 4.3).  So make sure that the switch is positioned so that the red dot is hidden.
<p>Also note the (relatively new) control in the (separate) main Settings app, under General => Sounds, called "Ringer and Alerts" volume, and a switch ("Change with Buttons").  By default, the switch is off, which means that the hardware buttons on the side of the iPad case do not control the volume of alert sounds, which is what Emerald Observatory uses to sound alarms.  If Emerald Observatory's sound isn't loud enough for you, make sure that the volume slider on that panel is all the way to the right.  (This new control is available in iOS 4.3.1, but I'm not sure when it appeared).
<p>Try other "alert" sounds on the device.  An easy test is to see if you can hear keyclicks when typing (but make sure that you have not disabled the keyclick sound; check the main Settings app, General -> Sounds => Keyboard Clicks).
<p>We've also had some reports from people with their device inside a case which (partially) covers the speaker, which is near the bottom of the case near the Home button.  Try with your iPad outside of the case.
<p>
</dd>


<dt> My time is exactly one hour off (or 2 hours or 3).
</dt>
<dd>
Most likely your iPad is set to the wrong timezone.  Check the Settings app, General tab, Date & Time.  Even if "Set Automatically" is ON it may not be correct.  Turn "Set Automatically" OFF, tap "Time Zone" and choose a city in your zone (the list of possible cities is fairly small but any city in your zone will do).
<p>
Note that even if you have the wrong timezone set the time shown in the status bar can look right since it always shows the time relative to whatever timezone is set.  But for its astronomical calculations Emerald Observatory needs to know the Universal Time (UTC) and that's computed from the local time and the timezone offset.
<P>
</dd>

<dt> When a Local Notification is fired for an alarm when the app is in the background, the sound keeps going even after I dismiss the dialog.
</dt>
<dd> This problem occurred on iOS 4.2 but was fixed with iOS 4.2.1 and iOS 4.3.  Updating your device to the latest OS should fix the problem.
<p>
</dd>

<dt>The little red dot on the Earth map is in the wrong place.
</dt>
<dd> Check your settings on the info page (accessed via the "i" button in the lower right corner of the screen).  If "Use Location Services" is On then Emerald Observatory is getting its location from iOS.   You may need to enable Location Services in the main Settings app and also make sure that the entry in that section for "Observatory" is On. If "Use Location Services" is Off then we use the value specified in the text entry boxes.  Be sure to use negative numbers for west longitudes and south latitudes.
<p>
</dd>

<dt>The sunrise/sunset times are wrong. The planet's azimuths and altitudes are wrong.
</dt>
<dd> Check the little red dot on the Earth map at the top of the screen; it should be at your location.  If not,
you may need to enter your latitude and longitude manually. 
 Tap the "info" button in the lower right corner.
Or it could be your timezone; see the previous section.
<p>
</dd>

<dt>The moonrise/moonset time is wrong.
</dt>
<dd>Make sure you're comparing the rise/set rings to the large 24-hour numbers on the outside of the dial, not the small 12-hour numbers on the inside.
<p>
</dd>

<dt>The moonrise/moonset time is wrong. It seems to be for the next day instead of today.
</dt>
<dd>
The way Emerald Observatory shows the rise and set times limits us to showing exactly one rise time and one set time.  But there are actually 3 rise (and 3 set) times that might be of interest: the most recent moonrise, the next moonrise and the moonrise that happened on this date.  Usually, the one for this date is equal to one of the others but sometimes there isn't one, i.e. the Moon doesn't rise some days (e.g. 2010 Dec 27 for Auckland, NZ).  Such cases would make a mess of our display if we were to try to always show the time for this date.  So what we do is show the time of the most recent rise or set event and the one after that.  That is the two events closest in time to the present.
<p>

Our iPhone app <a href="http://www.emeraldsequoia.com/h/ecsupport#faq2">Emerald Chronometer</a> shows this information in a variety of formats.  Some are just like Observatory.  But some just show the rise and set times on a separate dial.  In those cases, we have a little trick to display the fact that there's no rise or set at all on this date: we put both hands at the 12 oclock position and change the am/pm indictor.
<p>

All of this applies equally to the Sun and the other planets.  But only in the case of the Moon does the rise/set time change rapidly enough for anyone to notice.
  <img src="../images/smile.png" alt="smiley" align=center />
<p>
</dd>

<dt>The colored Sun ring doesn't always match the sunrise/sunset, twilight or golden hour indicators, particularly on days with Daylight Saving (Summer Time) transitions.
</dt>
<dd>
Emerald Observatory shows the twilight and golden hour indicators that "go with" the associated sunrise or sunset.  For example, if the sunrise for March 13 is shown, then the corresponding twilight indicators will also be for the morning of March 13.  This display switches from displaying the values for March 12 to March 13 exactly at sunset on March 12 (this follows from the rule in the previous answer).
<p>
The Sun ring, in contrast, always shows the data for exactly 12 local-time hours before and 12 local-time hours after the current time.  This rule is different because the Sun ring, by its nature, displays a continuously changing value for each time in the day, instead of just one or two events.
<p>
So it's possible that the Sun ring can be "out of sync" with the indicators.  This is typically only visible on days with Daylight Saving (Summer) Time transitions, because only then does the sunrise time move enough to notice.  But if you look closely you can see it on other days too, especially at high latitudes.
</dd>

<dt>Why don't you have an option to reset the iPad's internal clock, too?
</dt>
<dd> We would if we could but Apple won't let us.  Generally, letting apps mess around with the system's internals is a bad idea.  In this  particular case, it might be OK (if Apple really trusted us) but they're certainly not going to make a special case just for Emerald Sequoia.
<p>
</dd>

<dt>It looks like the planets aren't in the same positions as shown in the newspaper.
</dt>
<dd> Emerald Observatory shows the <b>heliocentric</b> positions of the planets; i.e. from a perspective far above the Sun's north pole (though greatly out of scale!).  That's often very different the geocentric position which is what is more commonly seen in newspapers etc.
<p>
Also, make sure you're not looking at the astrology section of the newspaper; their definition of the constellations doesn't match the actual present day sky.
<p>
</dd>

<dt>The zodiac symbols don't match the actual positions of the constellations in the sky.
</dt>
<dd>Right.  They're there just as labels for the 12-hour clock.  They are only very approximately related to their actual positions.
<p>
</dd>

<dt> When I start up Emerald Observatory sometimes the hands jump again after the initial animation.
</dt>
<dd> Yup.  Until we get the first reply from an NTP server we don't really know what the right time is.  It will be stable after that.
<P>
</dd>

<dt> If I move forward or backward by years or by centuries, keeping the date the same, the Earth shifts in position.
</dt>
<dd> That's right.  From 1582 onward Emerald Observatory uses the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar">Gregorian calendar&nbsp;<img src="extlink.png" alt=""/></a>, which keeps more or less in sync with the Earth's position (but because it does so in jumps on leap years there's a bit of a "wobble" from year to year and century to century).  Prior to 1582, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar">Julian calendar&nbsp;<img src="extlink.png" alt=""/></a> is used, which (because it has no leap days) does not precisely track the motion of the Earth around the Sun.  Thus as you move backwards from present day to 1582, you'll see the Earth move slightly back and forth, but there will be a jump at 25 October 1582 as we shift to the Julian calendar, and then a gradual and accumulating shift every year further you go into the past (we continue to use a "proleptic" Julian calendar even prior to its historical introduction because the lack of a consistent standard prior to that time).
<P>
</dd>

<dt> I can't seem to get an NTP sync.
</dt>
<dd> If the NTP status indicator is flashing and the network activity indicator in the status bar is going then Emerald Observatory is trying to communicate with an NTP server.  This may take up to a minute or two (though it usually takes just a couple of seconds).  If after a couple of minutes the indicator is still not steady green than there's a connectivity problem.  Check that you can access a reliable website (eg. google.com).  If you can get to the Web but still can't get an NTP sync then the problem is likely related to a firewall issue.  NTP requires that UDP port 123 be accessible.  If you're using a residential DSL or cable modem you may have to adjust your firewall settings; if you're at work, you may have to call your IT department.  There shouldn't really be a security issue with NTP and the amount of traffic it generates is very small.
<P>
</dd>

<dt> Why is it asking to use my location?
</dt>
<dd>Emerald Observatory needs to know your location in order to compute various astronomical quantities (eg. sunrise time).  That's all we use it for.  The data is stored on your device only.   We do not transmit it anywhere.  We do not sell it to anyone.  We update it each time the app starts up and about once an hour thereafter.   It will be copied to your computer when you sync with iTunes so you may want to encrypt your backups. 
<p>
</dd>

<dt> It sure would be nice if ...
</dt>
<dd> Don't hesitate to send us enchancement requests.
Some of the ideas we've gotten have been really interesting!
We're only a two-person company, so we can't promise if or when any particular request will be implemented.
But the more requests we get from our customers for a particular feature the higher its priority becomes.
Unless we think it's really cool and do it right away.

<dt> Translation issues
</dt>
<dd>
We're English-only speakers so we have to rely on others for translation.  If you find something that's poorly translated please let us know and we'll fix it up.  And if you would like to help translate Emerald Observatory into another language we would greatly appreciate it.  (Thanks, Ben!)

Emerald Observatory is an iPadâ¢ application which displays a variety of astronomical information.
It is similar in that way to our flagship products, 
<a href="../h/index.html">Emerald Chronometer</a><sup>&#0174;</sup> and <a href="../h/echd.html">Emerald Chronometer HD</a>, but
designed from the start to take advantage of the iPad's larger display.
Much of the supporting technology,
including NTP (atomic time) and the highly accurate astronomical algorithms, was derived from Emerald Chronometer.


 <h3>Displays</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Clock
<dd>
First of all, it's an ordinary clock.
The main hands (gold colored) display the hours, minutes and seconds in the usual 12-hour format.
To read it more precisely use the small numbers and tick marks on the inner edge of the rings.
The thin central hand with the large white arrow head and the large white numbers and tick marks indicate the time in 24-hour format (with noon on top by default).
<p>
Emerald Observatory's time may not exactly match the time in the iPad's status bar becausethe iPad's clock is often not very accurate whereas Emerald Observatory's time is synchronized with the international standard atomic clocks.  This is usually accurate to about +/- 0.100 seconds. This is accomplished with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol">Network Time Protocol (NTP)</a>&nbsp;<img src="extlink.png" alt=""/> so it must have a Net connection to get a sync.  If the Net is not available, it will fall back to the internal clock's value.
<p>
<!-- <blockquote><font size=-1>
    iPads with GPS have a far more accurate time standard directly from the satellites, good to less than +/- a microsecond.  But Apple has chosen not to use it and not to make it available to applications.
</font></blockquote>
<p> -->
It is also possible to change the clock's time and to animate it at very high rates. See <a href="#setmode">Set Mode</a>, below.
 <dt>Moon
 <dd>
     In the upper left Emerald Observatory displays the Moon as it appears from the current location at the clock's time.
When the phase is a thin crescent EO simulates the illumination of the dark side by reflected light from the Earth (this is known as "Earthlight" or "<a href="http://science.msfc.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2002/12apr_earthshine/">Earthshine</a>&nbsp;<img src="extlink.png" alt=""/>" or "the Moon's ashen glow").
In addition, the image rotates to match the Moon's apparent orientation as it moves across the sky and changes size to match the Moon's apparent size as its distance from the Earth changes around its elliptical orbit. (EO does not show the Moon's libration.)
<p>
<a href="#animate">Animate</a> the clock at one day per tick to see the Moon go thru its phases and size changes.
Tap the phase button to see the times and dates of the quarters (New, 1st Quarter, Full, 3rd Quarter).
<p>

 <dt>Earth
 <dd>
The map of the Earth (a <a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/BlueMarble/">NASA composite of thousands of images</a>&nbsp;<img src="extlink.png" alt=""/>) at the top of the screen shows which parts of the Earth are facing the Sun and which parts are in night.
The image changes each month to reflect the changing snow and vegatation cover.
The lights of mankind's cities are shown for the nighttime region. 
  They roughly correspond to the human population density and level of energy use at the present time.
<!--(Or perhaps more correctly to the amount of energy wasted by inefficient lighting.)-->
(The data was collected by the US Air Force DMSP satellites in the mid 1990s.)
<p>
The small red dot on the Earth marks the current location being used by Emerald Observatory for its astronomical calculations
 (usually the current  location but you can change it; see  <a href="#settings">Settings</a>, below).  It is important that this be the location for which you want the astronomical information to be shown and that the matching timezone is set in the iPad's Settings app.
<p>
<a href="#animate">Animate</a> at one hour per tick to see the terminator (the "edge of night") move around the world.
Animate at one month per tick to see the seasonal changes; note the changing shape and position of the terminator.
<p>

 <dt>Day/date
<dd>
In portrait orientation the year, month, day and day of the week appear in the upper right; in landscape they're at the bottom of the screen.  They are shown in the language specified in the General->International section of the Settings app.
The year is shown in red for BCE dates ("Before Common Era", a.k.a. "BC").
A small indicator appears to the right of the year in leap years.
<p>

 <dt>Alarm time
<dd>
If the alarm is set (see <a href="#settings">Settings</a> below) a red circle enclosing a musical symbol appears outside the main 24-hour dial to mark the alarm time.  When the white 24-hour hand reaches the alarm indicator the alarm will sound.
<p>

<img src="rings.png" alt="rise/set rings" align=right hspace=4 />
 <dt>Main dial
 <dd>
        <li>Rise/Set rings</li>
There are 6 thin concentric partial rings, one for each of the classical "planets".  The innermost one is for the Moon, followed by Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn on the outside.  The larger one behind the others is for the Sun.
The filled region of the ring represents the time (read against the 24-hour markings) when the planet is above the horizon;
 it rises and sets at the ends of the arc and transits at the midpoint.
Thus if the thin white arm of the 24-hour hand crosses the filled part of a planet's ring then that planet is currently above the horizon.
<p>
The large ring for the Sun is colored according to the Sun's altitude above the horizon at each time; sunrise and sunset are at the sharp boundary between red and blue.
<p>
     <li>Twilight hands</li>
There are 12 colored hands on the 24-hour dial which mark special times related to the altitude of the Sun.  The light yellow one marks the time of solar noon, when  the Sun is at its highest point in the sky for the day; the dark blue one is 12 hours later when the Sun is farthest below the horizon.
The orange ones mark the times of sunrise and sunset.  
The three blue ones mark the times when the Sun is 6, 12, and 18 degrees below the horizon which define the beginning and ending of civil, nautical and astronomical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight">twilight</a>&nbsp;<img src="extlink.png" alt=""/>.
The dark yellow ones mark the time when the Sun is 15 degrees above the horizon, indicating the "golden hour" (which maybe be considerably longer than an hour at high latitudes) when the light is usually best for outdoor photography.
<p>
Note that at high latitudes when the sun's altitude changes slowly the golden and blue regions will elongate.  In extreme cases some of the twilight hands will disappear altogether if the Sun never reaches their level.
See this effect by changing to a high latitude on the <a href="#settings">settings page</a> and then <a href="#animate">animating</a> by days or months.
<br clear=all>
<p>
     <li>Timezone indicator</li>
Between the center and the 6 o'clock position is a simple label showing the abbreviation of the current timezone.
It changes to reflect daylight time (summer time) vs standard time for those timezones
that observe DST.
EO's astronomical calculations depend on the timezone offset and geographic location.
Use the Settings app ("General->Date & Time") to change the timezone if necessary.
<p>
     <li>Orrery</li>
Inside the main dial Emerald Observatory displays the orbital positions of the 6 innermost planets
 (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn) plus the Earth's Moon
from a perspective above the Sun's north pole
with respect to the present positions of constellations of the zodiac.
The approximate positions of constellations are marked by their traditional astrological symbols in large gray type.
<p>
<div align=center>
<img src="zodiacTable.png" alt="zodiac symbols"/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="orrery.png" alt="orrery image"/>
</div>
<p>
<blockquote><font size=-1>
Note that the constellation positions shown in Emerald Observatory are based on their actual positions in the present-day sky and thus do not correspond to the definitions used by western astrologers.
</font></blockquote>
<p>
 <p>
The best rate for <a href="#animate">animating</a> this display depends on which planet you're concerned with. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler's_laws_of_planetary_motion">Kepler's third law</a>&nbsp;<img src="extlink.png" alt=""/> shows that the inner planets orbit much faster than the outer ones. So animating by days works best for Mercury or the Moon whereas years is best for Saturn.
<p>
If you animate by years you'll notice that the Earth jitters a little.  This is not a bug.
It's because we're advancing by exactly one calendar year but the Earth's orbital period is about 365.25 days.  So the Earth falls behind a little for three years and then catches up on the leap year.  Prior to 15 October 1582 Emerald Observatory uses the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar">Julian calendar</a>&nbsp;<img src="extlink.png" alt=""/> rather than the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar">Gregorian</a>&nbsp;<img src="extlink.png" alt=""/>, so you'll see the Earth jump in 1582 and then it will gradually shift in position from year to year back from that time (reflecting the error in the Julian calendar).
 <dt>Inner subdials
 <dd>
<li>UTC</li>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utc">UTC</a>&nbsp;<img src="extlink.png" alt=""/></a>
("Coordinated Universal Time") is a worldwide time standard based on atomic clocks that is adjusted (by the occasional addition of "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second">leap  seconds</a>&nbsp;<img src="extlink.png" alt=""/>") to be very close to the mean solar time at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, England ("GMT").
Ordinary civil time in most locations is defined by an offset from UTC.
<p>
<li>Solar</li>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_time">Solar time</a>&nbsp;<img src="extlink.png" alt=""/>
(technically: "apparent solar time") is what everyone used before the invention of clocks and timezones; it will show 12 noon at exactly the time when the Sun crosses the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meridian_(astronomy)">meridian</a>&nbsp;<img src="extlink.png" alt=""/>
 (of course, this is also when the 24-hour hand coincides with the solar noon hand on the outer dial).  Apparent solar time is what an ordinary sundial shows.
<p>
<li>Sidereal</li>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_time">Sidereal time</a>&nbsp;<img src="extlink.png" alt=""/>
tracks the apparent motion of the stars around the Earth; the Earth rotates exactly once in 24 sidereal hours as measured against the stars.
That 24-hour sidereal day is a few minutes shorter than a solar (or civil) day because of the Earth's motion in its orbit around the Sun.
A star that is overhead at a given sidereal time during the day will always be overhead at that same sidereal time, no matter what season it is.
<p>
The sidereal time dial is labeled with the abbreviations of the zodiac constellations and the corresponding numbers.  The hour hand points to the constellation that is currently near the meridian.
<p>
UTC and sidereal time are shown in 24-hour format; solar time in 12-hour format.
<p>
 <dt>Outer subdials
<dd>
      <li>Altitude and Azimuth</li>
The two dials on the left side of the screen show the altitude (angle of the object up from the horizon) and azimuth (angle of the object around the horizon clockwise from North) of one of the planets at the clock's time.
You can cycle through the 7 "planets" (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn) by tapping either dial.
<p>
<a name="EOT"></a>
      <li>Equation of Time</li>
The "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_time">Equation of Time</a>&nbsp;<img src="extlink.png" alt=""/>" is the difference, due primarily to the ellipticity of the Earth's orbit, between between apparent solar time (see above) and mean solar time.  Mean solar time is apparent solar time averaged over a whole year.  Ordinary civil time is very close to mean solar time at the standard meridian of each timezone.  So EOT is the difference between your watch and a sundial on the standard meridian of your timezone.
<p>
The dial is marked in minutes; positive means the sundial is ahead.
In the days of celestial navigation, the EOT for the day was an essential input to a navigator's longitude calculation.
<a name="greg"></a>
<p>
    <li>Eclipse Simulator</li>
<p><div align=center><img align=center src="5eclipses.png" alt="5 eclipses" /></div><p>
The small dial labeled 'Eclipse Simulator' has three icons in the outer ring, representing the Sun, Moon, and Earth's shadow and two thin red lines indicating the nodes of the Moon's orbit (points where it intersects the plane of the ecliptic).  The icons are positioned around the ring according to their geocentric ecliptic longitude. When both the Sun and Moon coincide with a node then an eclipse is possible. The area inside the ring is normally empty but near the time of a lunar or solar eclipse an animation of the eclipse will appear there.  Lunar eclipses are visible from an entire hemisphere of the Earth but solar eclipses are visible only from a very small area.  See <a href="http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse.html">here</a> for a list of times and locations of recent and upcoming eclipses (and much more).
<p>
Since eclipses happen at (or very near) full moon and new moon, you can use the "phase" button in Set mode to move forward to new and full moon dates, and see if there is anything inside the Eclipse Simulator subdial.  Eclipses will only happen when the red lines indicating the nodal points are close to the Sun and Moon.  You may need to move forward or backward by hours or minutes from the phase point to see the point of maximum ecilpse at your location for a given eclipse.  Note that solar eclipses, which are much rarer, typically are only visible on a portion of the Earth's surface.  But you can simulate those eclipses with Emerald Observatory too, by entering the "location of maximum eclipse" into the latitude and longitude fields on the Settings page, and viewing the eclipse as it will appear there.
<p>
Emerald Observatory's database of locations for the Sun and Moon extend back to 4000 BCE, as mentioned above, but there is somewhat less precision for those early dates than there is for modern times.  Since the difference between total and partial eclipse can be a small fraction of a degree, historical eclipses may not be shown with 100% fidelity.  Modern events, however, are shown with very high precision.
<!--
<p>
    <li>Year indicators</li>
The hand of this dial indicates the phase of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar">Gregorian calendar</a>&nbsp;<img src="extlink.png" alt=""/> cycle for the current year
(which appears beneath the center).
1, 2, 3, and 100 are regular years; 4 and 400 are leap years.
<p>
The little icons in the interior represent the seasons (clockwise from upper left: spring, summer, fall, winter).  The one for the current season is brighter.
The transitions happen at the precise time of the Earth's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox">equinoxes</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice">solstices</a>.
-->
<p>
</dl>
 <h3>Controls</h3>
<dl>
<a name="setmode"></a>
      <dt>Set Mode
<dd>
Tapping the "Set" button just above the top of the main dial:
<P>
<img align=center src="setbuts1.png" alt="set button" /><p>
<p>
 stops the clock and enters Set mode.  "Set" then changes to "Reset" and
 two sets of  buttons labeled with time units appear on either side: 
<p>
<img  src="setbuts2.png" alt="time setting buttons" /><p>
The blue ones on the right move Emerald Observatory's time forward by one unit; the red ones on the left move it in reverse.
The "phase" buttons change to the time of the next or previous quarter Moon
 (you can then read the time and date from the main display).  
Tapping Reset changes it back to "Set", exits Set Mode, restarts the clock, and hides the other buttons.
<p>
When the displayed time is not the current time a red label appears at the top of the screen showing the displayed time and its offset from the current time.
<p>
Emerald Observatory can be set to any date from 4000 BCE through 2800 CE.
<p>
<a name="animate"></a>
<dt>Animation
<dd>
Press and hold any of the buttons in Set Mode to animate the display (step continuously).  Slide your finger off the button before raising it to "latch" the button and advance continuously.  Tap it again to "unlatch" it.
	  You can have more than one button active at once.  Tap "Reset" to the return to the present time.
<p>
      <dt>Hot Spots
<dd>
There are two additional invisible active buttons on the screen on the altitude and azimuth dials.
Tapping either of them switches both dials to display the values for the next planet in the cycle (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Sun, ...).  The two cycle in opposite directions to avoid the need to cycle all the way around again if you go one too far.
<p>
<dt>NTP status indicator
<dd>
The dot in the lower left blinks while NTP is communicating with the servers to synchronize the time;
 it is steady after that process is complete.
It is green if a good sync has been accomplished, yellow otherwise.
<p>
      <dt>Orientation
<dd>
Emerald Observatory functions identically in both orientations but its layout is slightly different when the iPad is rotated into landscape mode:
<p>
	 <center> <img align=center src="Observatory-2.png" alt="landscape view" /></center>
<br clear=all>
<a name="settings"></a>
      <dt>Settings
<dd>
<img src="settings1.png" alt="settings controls" align=right hspace=4 />
The familiar small "i" in the lower right corner
 flips the display to a settings and help screen:
<p>
<li>Alarm</li>
The first switch enables/disables the alarm.  The label immediately to the right of the switch shows the alarm time even if it is currently disabled.  The "Set" and "Test" buttons appear only when it is enabled.  The picker wheels appear when the "Set" button is tapped; spin them to the desired time then tap anywhere outside the popup to dismiss it.  Tap the "Test" button to hear the sound; tap anywhere on the screen to silence it.
<p>
The alarm will sound for about 20 seconds (10 rings) or you can tap anywhere on the screen to silence it.  It is based on real time only; it does not sound if the alarm time is reached in Set mode.  It will sound if the screen is locked while Emerald Observatory is running.  If run under iOS 3.2 the alarm will not sound unless Emerald Observatory is the currently active app; with iOS 4.2 or later a local notification will be issued in that case.
<p>
The alarm will repeat at the same time each day.

<p>
<li>Noon on Top</li>
Most 24-hour clocks have midnight (0 or 24) at the top of the dial.  But when the clock also shows an indication of the day/night hours it is convenient to have noon (12) on top.  As there seems to be little consensus on this issue, EO lets you choose for yourself.
<p>
<li>Use Location Services</li>
This switch controls whether Emerald Observatory will use the iPad's builtin location finding hardware.
For those situations where that is not sufficient (e.g. a WiFi-only iPad not near a registered WiFi node) you can turn the switch to OFF and enter your own values for latitude and longitude.  Enter the values in decimal format with negative numbers for west  longitudes and south latitudes. Check the red dot on the Earth map on the main screen to ensure the values are correct. Also make sure that the corresponding timezone is set.  (The timezone abbreviation is displayed at the very top of the Settings/Help screen and on the main dial; it is set with the Settings app, "General->Date & Time".)
<p>
<li>Disable Auto-lock</li>
The final pair of switches disable the iPad's automatic sleep mode. The top one controls what happens when your iPad is connected to a power source, the bottom one when it's running on battery.  If the switch is ON your iPad will not sleep regardless of the Auto-lock setting in the Settings app.  Be careful with the 'on battery' setting; Emerald Observatory will deplete the iPad's battery in just a few hours.
<p>
<li>Help</li>
The remainder of the screen is a brief summary of the app's capabilities.  Scroll to the bottom to see the boring copyright notices.  Tap the Emerald Sequoia logo at the very bottom to get back to this web page.

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<dl>
<a name="faq1"></a>
<dt> My iPhoneâ¢ is only off by 4 seconds; why do I need this silly app?
</dt>
<dd>
You don't.  But some of us think such an error is insanely huge for a 21st century computer.  It's just not right.
<p>

<dt> It doesn't properly work on the iPad</dt>
<dd>Please upgrade to version 1.3 or later.<p></dd>

<dt> The seconds have disappeared!</dt>
<dd>Tap the seconds window.  That cycles between displaying the seconds with tenths, the seconds only and nothing at all.  That's convenient if you find the blinking seconds annoying.  But it's confusing if you don't know that.  Now you do.<p></dd>

<dt> What does a "?" in the upper right mean?</dt>
<dd>That Emerald Time can't contact any servers.  Make sure you really have internet connectivity.  Be patient.  Or tap the lights to force another retry.  Sometimes it takes several tries.  <p></dd>

<dt> All the servers in the list are red or gray like the picture above.</dt>
<dd>See previous answer.<p></dd>

<dt> What do the colors mean in the table of stats?</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li style="color:gray">Gray: no attempt has yet been made to contact this server
<li style="color:red">Red: unable to contact the server
<li style="color:orange">Orange: making the first attempts to contact the server
<li style="color:yellow">Yellow: getting data from the server but not yet enough
<li style="color:cyan">Cyan: same as green but the green one had more consistent statistics
<li style="color:green">Green: Emerald Time has suficient good data to accurately determine the server's time
</UL>
<p></dd>

<dt> What are those funny server names? </dt>
<dd>Emerald Time uses servers from the <a href="http://www.pool.ntp.org/">NTP Pool Project</a>.  The addresses you see are not real; they just redirect (more or less at random) to the real servers.  You will not get the same real server each time.  This is good.<p></dd>

<dt> But what if I somehow get connected to a really remote server on another continent? </dt>
<dd>It will probably work just fine.  An NTP server half way around the world seems to be able to supply a more accurate time than the cell phone tower a mile away.  But Emerald Time picks the best of the servers it tries anyway, so it's not likely that a really distant one will be picked.<p></dd>

<dt> My iPhone has GPS built in.  Doesn't that have a really accurate clock? </dt>
<dd>It sure does, and it's accurate to a few nanoseconds (if it wasn't it wouldn't work).  In fact, GPS receivers are very often used as the reference standard for NTP servers.  But iOS does not use the GPS time information.  And of course, some devices don't have GPS.<p></dd>

<dt> I ran Emerald Time and it got a good time setting.  But when I quit the device's clock went back to what it was before. </dt>
<dd>Yeah, that's how it works.  Setting the system clock requires root privileges which are granted only to Apple's own apps.  This is probably a good thing in general; you really don't want random programs messing with your system.<p></dd>

<dt> What's that misshaped "o" at the head of the middle column? </dt>
<dd>That's the Greek letter sigma (Ï) which is conventionally used to represent a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation">standard deviation</a>.<p></dd>

<dt> I'm confused about how to set "Disable Auto-Lock"... </dt>
<dd>Yes, it's a little confusing.  iOS's system-wide option is called "Auto-Lock"; when it's enabled (set to something other than "Never") the screen blanks after a while.  This is often not the behavior you want in an app like Emerald Time so we have an option to disable the system-wide feature for our app only.  Thus when our option "Disable Auto-Lock" is ON the screen should not blank out while Emerald Time is running (as if "Auto-Lock" was set to "Never"). Be careful with this when your device is not plugged in.

<h1>Emerald Time</h1>
<div style='text-align:center; width: 100%'>
 <span class="smallest">Version 1.6.2</span><br><br>
 <img src="ET2.png">
</div>
<br><p>

Emerald Time is a little iPhone/iPadâ¢ application that uses
<a href="http://www.ntp.org/">Network Time Protocol (NTP)</a>
 servers on the Internet to obtain a more accurate time
than is typically available from the iPhone's internal clock, which can be off by several seconds or more.
<div style="float:right; width:33%; color:white">
<ul>
<li><a href='http://www.appreview.com/applications/10543'><img style='vertical-align: middle' src="AppReviewBetter.badge.png" border='0' vspace='12'></a>
</ul>
</div>
<p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<div class="smaller">
<ul>
  <li> geeky stats
  <li> blinky lights and numbers
  <li> display options for
    <ul>
    <li> 12- or 24-hour format
    <li> UTC or local time zones
    <li> seconds & tenths
    </ul>
  <li> NTP accuracy
  <li> live leap second display
  <li> totally free
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Displays</h3>

   The colored number at the upper right is the offset (difference in seconds) between the true time and the device's internal clock; positive means the internal clock is behind. The color's saturation is based on how far the offset is from zero; white means the offset is very small.  If an NTP connection cannot be made a gray "?" will appear instead.
<p>

   The four items inside the cloud represent some of the NTP servers that have been contacted.  While Emerald Time is actually in communication with a server it shows that server's time.  After it disconnects only the difference between that server's clock and the iPhone's internal clock is shown.  The best value (not necessarily the smallest one) is shown in green.
Question marks are shown when there has not yet been a successful connection.
<p>

   The red/yellow/green lights above the time show the progress of the server connections.  When Emerald Time has enough good data the green light is on.  The other lights appear only while data is being collected.
<p>

<h3>Controls</h3>

<img src="servers-1.png" align=right hspace=4>
   There are eight hot spots that you can tap. Tapping on AM/PM, time zone or hours:minutes will cycle between 12- and 24-hour time and between your local time zone and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utc">UTC</a> ("GMT").
Tapping the seconds will cycle between seconds with tenths, just seconds, and nothing.
<p>

   For the truly obsessed (and for the convenience of the developers) tapping anywhere on the cloud brings up a table of server statistics as shown to the right:  "n" is the number of good/bad packets received; "offset" is the difference between that server's clock and the internal clock; "Ï" is the standard deviation; "rtt" is the average round-trip time to that server (in milliseconds). The colors indicate the state of the server connection.  Tap again to return to the cloud.
<p>

   Tapping the offset or any of the lights makes Emerald Time immediately contact the NTP servers again to recompute a new offset.  That burns up some network packets and makes a nice light show, especially with the server info table showing.
<p>

   The "i" brings up the built-in version of this documentation.
<br clear=all>

<h3>Notes</h3>
   Unfortunately, 3rd party iOS applications cannot change the internal clock.  So Emerald Time can display the right time but it can't make it available to other apps.
<p>

   Emerald Time has an option to disable the global Auto-lock so that the device does not sleep while Emerald Time is running.
You set this option in the applications section (at the bottom) of the Settings app.
 This will drain your battery in just a few hours; best to keep it on the charger.
<p>

Emerald Time's Settings app section also has a provision for adding an additional NTP server. You may enter either a hostname an IP address.  Restart the app or tap the lights to do a new sync after changing the option.
<p>

   Emerald Time periodically goes out to the Internet to get data from the NTP servers so beware of data <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roaming">roaming charges</a>.  If the network is unavailable, it will try repeatedly with longer and longer intervals between attempts.  You can always force another attempt by pressing the lights.
<p>

   Emerald Time chooses which NTP servers to contact based on your locale (see Settings->General->International->Region Format).  It will usually work more efficiently if you have that set correctly.
<p>

   Don't be surprised if the offset changes occasionally.  Devices with 3G capability frequently update their internal clocks from the cell phone network.  Emerald Time sees that, contacts the NTP servers again and calculates the new offset.  The displayed time should not change but the new offset may be quite different from the previous one.  If your friends' devices are also running Emerald Time their offsets may be different but the displayed times should all be the same!
<p>

   Emerald Time primarily uses servers from the <a href="http://www.pool.ntp.org/">NTP Pool Project</a> but it also includes Apple's default NTP server(s).

There are two indicator lights at the top corners of the screen.
The left one shows
Emerald Chronometer's time synchronization status while the right one shows
its location status.
The lights are green if Emerald Chronometer is successfully synchronized;
blinking means the operation is in progress.
A location fix is marked as 'green' if it is less than 30 minutes old,
so even in airplane mode the location status may appear green until the previous fix is older than that.
The location indicator will be purple if the location is set manually.
The time indicator will be purple if the manually set timezone is not the same as the iPhone's default.
A red ring will appear around the time indicator if there is a large difference between the iPhone time and the NTP time (check your Time & Date settings).
See <a href="Settings.html" target="_top">Option Settings</a> for more.

<center><h2>Accuracy of the<br>Astronomical Algorithms</h2></center>

<h3>General rule</h3>
As a general rule, you can assume that all of the astronomical
displays within Emerald Chronometer are at least as accurate as the
precision with which you can read the display, from about 4000 BCE to
about 2800 CE.
<span class='Chronometer'>
For example, the
azimuth displays on Haleakala can be read approximately to the nearest
degree, and there is far more accuracy in the data than that.
</span>
<p>
<span class='Chronometer'>
Similarly, the
</span>
<span class='GenevaOnly'>
For example, the
</span>
rise and set dials, which can be read to the nearest
minute, are at least that accurate.  But note of course that they are only valid
if the rise or set point on the horizon is at exactly the same level
as you are; if the Sun is setting behind a hill above you, for example, it will
set much earlier than the time indicated.
<p>
The displays depend heavily on having the correct time and location.
If you have NTP synchronization and Location Services turned on,
the correct time zone set in the iPhone's Settings app, and have green
lights at the top of the display, you can presume that everything you
are looking at is as accurate as you can read it.  In general, those green lights
mean you have about a kilometer (half a mile) of accuracy and are within a
half second of the correct time.
<h3>Specifics</h3>
The algorithms employed in Emerald Chronometer
are very high-precision series calculations originally developed by
astronomers at the Bureau des Longitudes in Paris in the 1980s and
1990s.  They are particularly well-suited for the iPhone because the
data tables they are based on can fit in about 500 kilobytes of memory
(this includes data for most planets for the same period), and yet
still produce accuracy of less than 1/100 of a degree over the entire
period mentioned.  No Internet connection is required for any
astronomical calculation.
<p>
Specifically, the tables employed are from <a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0943396336/billarnett'>Lunar Tables and Programs
from 4000 B.C. to A.D. 8000<img src="extlink.png"></a>, by Michelle Chapront-Touz&eacute; & Jean
Chapront, copyright 1991, and
<a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0943396085/billarnett'>Planetary Programs and Tables from -4000 to +2800<img src="extlink.png"></a>, by Pierre
Bretagnon & Jean-Louis Simon, copyright 1986, both published by
Willmann-Bell, Inc. (the latter includes the Sun motion tables).
<p>
The algorithms presented in those books were ported to C for use in the
iPhone development environment, and local caches were developed to
avoid recalculation of common quantities.  The time conversions in
those books have been superceded by more accurate ones, described below.
<p>
As a side note, the iPhone is a potent floating-point calculating
machine; every time you move the Sun or Moon hand on Mauna Kea a
little bit, over a thousand double-precision sines and cosines are
calculated, whose arguments are themselves each polynomial expressions
with several terms, and it all gets done in much less than a tenth of
a second.  Early in their careers the authors of Emerald Chronometer
used machines that filled whole rooms with less horsepower than the
iPhone you're holding in your hand.
<p>
The RA display on Geneva displays the RA "of date", meaning the RA
applied from the equniox current on the given date.  This means that
the Local Sidereal Time (per its definition) also displays the
rotation from the equinox, and not from the equinox of J2000.  It also
means that the Sun, Moon, and lunar nodal points' RA "of date" may be
read from that dial.  The constellations are displayed in the exact
orientation found in J2000, but rotated according to the precession to
match their locations at the displayed time.  The P03 formulae for
general precession are used.
<p>
<div display='inline' class='Chronometer'>
In contrast, on Mauna Kea, the RA display is fixed in the zodiac
dial to be the J2000 RA numbers of the constellations, and so on that
dial may be read the J2000 RA of the Sun and Moon.  The local sidereal
time may thus be read from the front of MK only in centuries close to
J2000; at other times, the more accurate LST display on the back of Mauna
Kea may be used.

<h3>Historical data</h3>
As mentioned, you can use Emerald Chronometer
to display astronomical information going back to 4000 B.C.  However,
it is important to understand that the time scale going back that far
is subject to considerable uncertainty, due to uncertainties in the
exact rotational speed of the Earth in the past.
<p>
What that means in
practice is that the astronomical events happened as shown, but the
time of day may not be the exact time that they happened.  You can
find a discussion of the various time scales involved, notably
Ephemeris Time, or Terrestrial Dynamic Time, and Universal Time, in
many places on the web.
<p>
And, of course, the dates of events  depend on which calendar is used.
Emerald Chronometer uses the Gregorian calendar for future dates and for past dates back to 1582,
 and the Julian calendar from 1 BCE to 1582 CE.
  Prior to 1 BCE Emerald Chronometer uses a proleptic Julian calendar, with leap years
 on 1BCE, 5BCE, etc, back every four years.
  Until very recently calendar representations around the world have varied widely, 
so using Emerald Chronometer for historical dates requires an advanced knowledge
 of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology">Chronology<img src="extlink.png"></a>.
<p>
Emerald Chronometer always displays UTC, and uses that as the starting
point for its calculations, converting to Terrestrial Dynamic Time (TDT)
 using the polynomial expressions suggested by Fred Espenak
at <a href='http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEhelp/deltatpoly2004.html'>this
NASA site<img src="extlink.png"></a> based on the data in Morrison & Stephenson, 2004.

<h1>Emerald Chronometer Options</h1>

</div>

Emerald Chronometer's settings and options are accessed via the "gear" button in the lower
right corner of the screen.

There are global app options relating to time synchronization, geographic position, and screen auto-lock.  Following those are settings specific to a single watch.
Currently only <a href="Terra/Terra.html#Settings">Terra</a>
has any watch-specific settings.  See Terra's <a href="Terra/Terra.html#Settings">Help page</a>
for a description of those settings.
<p>

<a name="time"></a>
<h3>Time</h3>
Emerald Chronometer does not depend entirely on the iPhone's internal time, 
which is frequently off by several seconds
and can change abruptly as it contacts different cell phone towers.
This can be avoided, if you have Internet access, by using this option:
<center><img src="ntp.png" alt="ntp setting" vspace=4></center>
This tells Emerald Chronometer to synchronize its time using the Network Time Protocol (NTP).
The NTP time is stable and usually differs from the international standard atomic clocks
 by less than a few hundred milliseconds.
The indicator light will blink during the sync process (it can take some time if the network is flakey).
For a technical description of
what Emerald Chronometer does during synchronization, click <a href="TimeSync.html">here</a>.
"Use NTP" is ON by default.
<p>
When all else fails, you can set the date and time and time zone manually with the Settings App:
Settings -> General -> Date & Time.
<p>

Emerald Chronometer uses the Gregorian calendar for future dates and for past dates back to 1582,
 and the Julian calendar from 1 BCE to 1582 CE.
  Prior to 1 BCE Emerald Chronometer uses a proleptic Julian calendar, with leap years
 on 1BCE, 5BCE, etc, back every four years.
  Until very recently calendar representations around the world have varied widely, 
so using Emerald Chronometer for actual historical dates requires an advanced knowledge
 of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology">Chronology<img src="extlink.png"></a>
(far beyond the scope of this note).

<p>
Click <a href="AstroAccuracy.html">here</a> for a description of the accuracy of Emerald Chronometer's astronomical calculations.

<a name="loc"></a>
<h3>Geographic Position</h3>
You set the geographic location and timezone with these two options:
<center><img src="position.png" alt="position entry" vspace=4></center>
The right hand side labels indicate the current settings;
the text is blue if the item is set automatically, purple if set manually.
Tapping them brings up the screens described below.
<p>
Most astronomical calculations depend on your position on the Earth's surface.
So Emerald Chronometer has a number of ways to for you to specify a position; they are accessed via the locations options screen:
<center><img src="locationScreen.png" alt="location screen" vspace=4></center>
And the time displays depend on the timezone 
which you can specify via Emerald Chronometer's timezone setting screen:
<center><img src="tzScreen.png" alt="timezone screen" vspace=4></center>
<p>
By far the most important aspect of each of these are the switches at the top.
If they're both set to "ON" then your position and timezone will be determined automatically and in most cases that will be sufficient and you can stop reading now.
They are both ON by default.
See <a href="#autolocation">below</a> for a description of how these automatic determinations are made.
When the switches are ON the rest of the screen is a read-only display.
Since location and timezone are closely related the bottom section of the location screen
shows the  timezone  that is currently in effect; it is always read-only.

<h4>Manual location setting</h4>
If you turn the "Use Device Location" switch OFF the screen changes to the manual setting form:
<center><img src="manualLoc.png" alt="manual location screen" vspace=4></center><br>
Here you can set your location by entering a city name, by choosing a  city from your Contacts list, by entering latitude and longitude values, by scrolling the map, or by picking a previously used location:
<ul>
<li>Tap the search box near the top of the screen to enter the name of a city.
Emerald Chronometer has a built-in list of more than 80,000 cities that it will search for your entry.
Each time you type a character a new list of matches is  displayed.
Tap the "Search" button at the bottom of the keyboard to see the whole list.
When you pick a city from that display, Emerald Chronometer will use its latitude and longitude from the internal database.
The Internet is not required to use a city in the database; the map will not update without an Internet connection, but
Emerald Chronometer will use the data for the city.
<P>
<li>When text entry field on the name entry screen is empty, a bookmark icon will appear on the right side of the field:
<center><img src="bookmark.png" alt="manual location screen" vspace=4></center>
If you tap it, the standard Address Book interface will appear.
When you choose one of your Contacts, Emerald Chronometer will extract the city, state, and country information from it and
display a list of cities that match.  Just choose the appropriate one.
(Note that Emerald Chronometer uses only the city level info; it ignores the street address.  This is almost always sufficient for our astronomical calculations.)
<P>
<li>
If you know the latitude and longitude of your location you can simply enter those values in the two text fields.  
The values are in decimal degrees; use negative numbers for west longitudes and south latitudes.  The Internet is of course not required
to enter the latitude and longitude directly; the map will not update without an Internet connection, but Emerald Chronometer will use
the given coordinates.
<P>
<li>
The small map is read-only but if you tap it a full screen map will appear.
Scroll and zoom the big map using the usual iPhone map controls (flick to scroll, pinch to zoom, double tap to zoom in, double tap with two fingers to zoom out).
Tap the Set button in  the upper right corner of the screen to move the purple pin to the center of the crosshairs and use that location.
Switch between map and satellite views with the three buttons at the top center.
Return to the locations screen by tapping the Location button in the upper left.
<P>
<li>
Finally, you can always go back to a previously used location.  Just tap the Recents button and pick from the ensuing list.
New entries are automatically added to the list each time you exit the location setting screen.
You can remove or reorder entries in the list by tapping the Edit button.
</ul>

<a name="timezone"></a>
<h4>Manual Timezone setting</h4>
First note that if you have set your location manually as described above, there is usually no need to set
the timezone manually; it will automatically pick up the timezone of the chosen location in most cases.
<p>
If you turn the "Set Automatically" switch OFF  the timezone setting screen  changes to its manual entry form:
<center><img src="manualTZ.png" alt="manual timezone setting" vspace=4></center>
This is a two-level view of the world's 400+ timezones.  18 of the most commonly used zones are listed under the first entry;
otherwise first pick a continent then pick a city from the ensuing list.
A few non-standard but often seen timezones are listed in the last entry ("Other").
The currently chosen timezone will appear to the right of its continent name;
timezones with the same UTC offset as the currently chosen one will be shown in blue.
<p>
If you pick a timezone that doesn't seem to match your current location a warning box will appear.  
The same warning will appear if you choose a seemingly inappropriate location while the timezone is set manually.
This is just a warning, Emerald Chronometer will honor your choice.
  But be sure you know what you're doing if you see it.
Some of Emerald Chronometer's displays will be incorrect (or look very odd) if your location and timezone 
do not match
(eg, if you're in New York City but you set your longitude to "74" instead of "-74").
If you change either one manually make sure the other one is consistent. 
If you allow both to be set automatically then everything is usually OK.
<p>

<a name="autolock"></a>
<h3>Auto-lock</h3>
Turning on one of these options overrides the iPhone's normal Auto-Lock setting (in Settings->General)
so that Emerald Chronometer's display will remain active indefinitely.  There are two settings, one
which controls what happens when the phone is plugged into a power source, and a second which controls
what happens when the phone is running on battery power:
<br>
<center><img src="autolock.png" alt="auto-lock setting" vspace=4></center>
Warning: If the second option is enabled, this will drain the battery in
just a few hours.<p>This option applies only when Emerald Chronometer is running; it has no effect on other apps.
<p>

<a name="autolocation"></a>
<h3>Auto location</h3>
Emerald Chronometer uses the iPhone's "Location Services" to get the geographic location
it needs in order to calculate the times of astronomical events like
sunrise and sunset.
Location Services uses a variety of methods to determine location depending on the available hardware
including GPS, cell phone tower triangulation and a database of WiFi hotspots.
<p>
Emerald Chronometer will
start up assuming the same timezone and location settings as it had the  last time it was run.
It may then
take up to a minute or so to get an accurate location fix.
The location status indicator will blink during this process.
If Emerald Chronometer
is running when the fix is determined then the affected
watch hands will move to the correct positions.
<p>
To use Location Services, you must enable it in the General section of the  Settings app 
AND
set "Use Device Location" to "ON" in the locations screen.
<p>
In order to save battery energy, Emerald Chronometer asks for its location only at startup and at 30-minute intervals.
If you are in a fast-moving vehicle and want the utmost accuracy in the astronomical displays,
you can force another location update by entering the location setting screen again.
You can see it move in real time with the big map.
<p>
The algorithm used to determine the timezone when the "Set Automatically" switch is ON is based on the setting of the
"Use Device Location" switch.  If it is also ON then Emerald Chronometer just uses the timezone from iPhone OS.
This is in turn based on the settings in Settings->General->Date & Time;
when set to "Set Automatically" the timezone is received from the cell phone network
(which is not always right).
If Emerald Chronometer is in manual location mode, the auto-timezone is taken from our internal database.

<h3>Devices without GPS</h3>
The some iOS devices do not have GPS or cell phone triangulation or cell phone time synchronization.
But they do have WiFi.
If you take such a device to a "well-known" WiFi hot spot, and start up Emerald Chronometer there with "Use Device Location" ON,
then it will remember that location and use it until you uninstall the application or start it up in
another well-known location.  
Devices running iPhoneOS versions prior 3.2 use the "SkyHook" database of well-known locations;
you may be able to find one using
<a href=" http://www.skyhookwireless.com/howitworks/coverage.php">SkyHook's locator<img src="extlink.png"></a>.
You can even (if you're willing to wait for them to update their database)
<a href=" http://www.skyhookwireless.com/howitworks/submit_ap.php">enter your own WiFi access point<img src="extlink.png"></a>.
Devices running iOS 3.2 or newer use Apple's database.

<h1>Emerald Chronometer Time Synchronization</h1>

</div>



Emerald Chronometer uses a simplified version of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol">Network Time Protocol (NTP)<img src="extlink.png"></a>
to synchronize its time displays with time servers on the Internet.
That's the short and simple version.  The longer, more technical, version
follows:
<p>
Every time Emerald Chronometer starts up and the "Use NTP" option is ON
or whenever that option is changed to ON, the app
goes out to NTP servers on the Internet and asks for the current
time. It chooses a pool of servers based on the user's country
setting: first from the local country's pool, then the continent pool
for that country, then the global pool, and finally time.apple.com.
This progression happens each time we get a new synchronization; there
are four sets of servers in each pool.  Emerald Chronometer compares
the time thus obtained with the time supplied by the iPhone, and
stores the difference as a "skew" value.  This skew is applied
globally throughout the application to every watch
<span class='Chronometer'>
display, with a couple of exceptions described further on.
</span>
<span class='GenevaOnly'>
display.
</span>
<p>
The size of this skew is completely dependent on how accurate the time
supplied by the telephone carrier's signal is.  In the SF Bay Area
where the authors live, it typically varies by up to a few seconds in
either direction.  In other areas it is reportedly larger.  The iPod
touch uses a different synchronization mechanism, synchronizing with
your desktop computer, so there it will depend on the accuracy of your
desktop computer.
<span display='inline' class='device'>
(You can see the current skew value by tapping on
the upper lift indicator light on the main screen.)
</span>
<p>
When you shut down and restart Emerald Chronometer, it will start with the same
skew value as it determined during the previous session, but it will
also go get a new skew value in case it has changed since the last
time the application was run.  If the skew has changed (or if this is the first
time the application has ever been run), then the hands showing the time will jump
to the new correct value.
<p>
When the iPhone gets a new cell-phone time (for example, when it
switches to a different tower), the iPhone OS changes its internal
time base used by all applications, and sends a notification to
running applications that the time has changed.  When Emerald Chronometer
gets this notification, it immediately changes the skew
value by the amount that the internal time base has apparently
shifted; it determines this shift by comparing against another internal
time base that does not change with cell-tower changes (CACurrentMediaTime).
Then it again goes out to the NTP servers to get the actual skew,
which is typically quite close to the "educated guess".  Occasionally,
especially in fringe-reception areas, you will see the time indicator
blink for a few seconds while it does this.
<p>
<div display='inline' class='Chronometer'>
A result of this approach, including the reliance on CACurrentMediaTime while
the device is unlocked, is that interval timing is continuously accurate
even across time changes due to cell-tower time shifts, again so long as the
device is unlocked.  If the device is locked after timing starts but before
the first synchronization is obtained, however, accuracy is lost because there
is no way of definitively calibrating the starting time.  The mechanism is
a bit complex, but the end result is that hands which display interval timing
will move smoothly through cell-tower time changes before and including the first
synchronization, unlike other time hands.  After synchronization, all
hands will continue to move smoothly.
<p>
<span class='Chronometer'>
When waking up after the screen has been locked, Emerald Chronometer resynchronizes with NTP, because to save power the iPhone's internal clocks are allowed to shut down while the screen is locked.  To maintain full NTP synchronization while the screen is locked, you can set an alarm on Istanbul or Thebes; if an alarm is pending, Emerald Chronometer keeps the internal clocks going so that the alarm can be sounded at the correct time.  The battery will drain about 50% faster if an alarm is pending.
<p>
</span>
</div>
<span class='Chronometer'>
<h2>Notifications</h2>
Emerald Chronometer does not maintain NTP synchronization when it is running in the background.   Therefore,
if the iPhone's time base changes while Emerald Chronometer is not running, then alarm notifications for Istanbul and Thebes may be offset from their requested time.  That can happen in a number of circumstances:
<ul>
 <li> The iPhone and the iPad 3G, if set to "Set time automatically", change their time base by a few seconds frequently when changing cell towers.
 <li>If those devices turn off "Set time automatically", and for all other devices, the time is subject to the accuracy of the device's internal clock, which can be off by several seconds per day or more.
</ul>
To minimize these small errors when relying on alarms, bring up Emerald Chronometer occasionally (long enough for the top-left light to become solid green); this will reset the time base used for alarms.
<p>
In addition, the OS does not guarantee that local notifications are delivered at the exact time specified; there may be a few-second delay if the device is busy with other activity.

<dl>

<dt> It crashes on the new iPad!
</dt>
<dd> This bug is fixed in version 3.7.3 of Emerald Chronometer HD, which was released in the store on March 13.  The crash only occurs on the new iPad with Retina display.
<p>
If you see a problem and you are running ECHD 3.7.3, please let us know immediately at <a href="mailto:essupport@emeraldsequoia.com?subject=Emerald%20Chronometer">essupport@emeraldsequoia.com</a>.  Note that we have not yet updated the graphics to fully take advantage of the Retina display, as that is a significant effort.
<p>
</dd>

<dt> What's the difference between Emerald Chronometer and Emerald Chronometer HD?
</dt>
<dd> 
<ul>
<li>ECHD is for the iPad; EC is for the iPhone.
<li>ECHD runs only on iPad<span style="font-size:6pt; vertical-align: super">Â®</span> and iPad 2<span style="font-size:6pt; vertical-align: super">Â®</span>.  EC runs on all iOS devices but on iPads it runs in emulation mode only.
<li>ECHD's options pages have been reformatted for the larger screen (though their function remains the same).
<li>ECHD runs in both landscape and portrait orientations.
</ul>
</dd>

<dt> The buttons at the bottom left and right don't work for me, although swiping left and right works fine.
</dt>
<dd> We've had a few reports of this problem, all from customers running older versions of iOS (typically iOS 4.2.1).  We have heard from them that upgrading to iOS 4.3.3 fixes the problem.  (iPads that we own are all at iOS 4.3.x already and we've been unable to reproduce the problem with the simulator running an older version).
<p>
If you see this problem and you *are* running iOS 4.3.x, please let us know immediately at <a href="mailto:essupport@emeraldsequoia.com?subject=Emerald%20Chronometer">essupport@emeraldsequoia.com</a>.
<p>
</dd>

<dt> How come I have to pay again for the iPad version if I already have Emerald Chronometer?
</dt>
<dd> The iPad version was a significant amount of work for us. For more details, see <a href="http://emeraldsequoia.com/esblog/2011/05/07/emerald-chronometer-hd-and-ec-price-reduction/">our blog entry about this</a>.  You might also be interested in <a href="http://emeraldsequoia.com/esblog/2010/04/07/why-we-code/">why we code</a>.

<dt>That's an awfully short FAQ.  I have more questions.

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<dl>

<dt> I just see one watch and it's nothing like the screen shots on the App Store<span style="font-size:6pt; vertical-align: super">Â®</span>.
</dt>
<dd> Swipe left or right to see the others.  Tap the "i" button to read the help files.
 Or <a href="Application.html">click here</a>.
<p>
</dd>

<dt> I'm seeing crashes (Emerald Chronometer just abruptly disappears or hangs).
</dt>
<dd>That was a frequent occurrence for many apps with early versions of the iPhone OS.  If you're not running the latest version:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/softwareupdate/">http://www.apple.com/iphone/softwareupdate/</a><br>
then upgrading may well fix it.
And, of course, make sure you're using the latest version of Emerald Chronometer (at least 3.0).
If you see a crash with the latest versions of Emerald Chronometer and iOS, and you're not running a jailbroken phone (see below), PLEASE report it to the email address below.
<p> 
That said, in many cases, it will work if you just try again.  You may have to turn the iPhone's power off and back on
(hold down the sleep/wake button for a few seconds until you get the power off message). You may have to do this twice.
If that doesn't fix it, the next step is to remove the app and download it again.
Despite appearances, this will be free.
Here are Apple's instructions for reloading an app:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1702">http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1702</a><br>
It may be important to restore the app <em>with iTunes<span style="font-size:6pt; vertical-align: super">Â®</span></em> not with the App Store app on the phone itself.
If your iPhone is nearly full (i.e. less than 10% free space as reported at the bottom of your phone's Info tab in iTunes) 
that may also cause problems.

<p>
</dd>

<dt> When a Local Notification is fired for an alarm when the app is in the background, the sound keeps going even after I dismiss the dialog.
</dt>
<dd> This problem occurred on iOS 4.2 but was fixed with iOS 4.2.1 and iOS 4.3.  Updating your device to the latest OS should fix the problem.
<p>
</dd>

<dt> The alarm doesn't work if Chronometer is in the background or if the screen is locked (iOS 5 or later).
</dt>
<dd>Go to the Settings app, choose the Notifications item on the left side, and scroll down on the right side until you see "Chronometer".
Tap on it and then turn on the switch for "Sounds".  That will allow the alarm sound to play even when Emerald Chronometer is not active.
<p>
</dd>

<dt> Why did the app size increase so dramatically with Emerald Chronometer version 3.3?
</dt>
<dd> Because of the larger artwork needed for the Retina display.  For more details, see <a href="http://emeraldsequoia.com/esblog/2010/11/08/retina-support-and-app-size/">our blog entry about this</a>.
<p>
</dd>

<dt> The documentation claims it shows moonrise and set times but I don't see that anywhere.
</dt>
<dd> Many features appear only on the "back" side of a watch.  Click the button on the lower left corner
of the screen to switch sides.  (The moon rise/set info is on the backs of Haleakala and several others.)
<p>
</dd>

<dt> Sometimes I see a miniature version of the watch for a second and it says "Loading".  What does that mean?
</dt>
<dd> It means we're reading the data describing that watch from secondary storage.  That takes a while.  We don't have enough RAM to keep all the watches loaded at once.  We keep as many  loaded as possible but if  you swipe very quickly you can get ahead of our loader.
<p>
</dd>

<dt> Firenze's back and the other watches don't seem to agree about rise and set times.
</dt>
<dd>
Right.  And the Help is not entirely correct about
when the planets are visible with respect to the horizon mask.
Because Firenze only has a single horizon indicator for all of the
planets (we use "planet" to refer to the Sun and Moon too, in this
context), it is only a rough indication for any particular planet and
can be wrong in certain situations; use Miami if you want precise
information.  Specifically, the horizon indicator shows only the
azimuth of the intersections of the ecliptic plane with the horizon,
and thus is only exact when read against the Sun hand (or
against another planet's hand if the planet happens to lie exactly in the plane of the
ecliptic).  If the planet is outside the ecliptic plane (that is, if
its ecliptic latitude is nonzero), then the horizon indicator for that
planet can be wrong in two circumstances:
<br>
&nbsp; * Close to the time of rise or set
<br>
&nbsp; * Close to the time when the ecliptic plane passes through the zenith, as it does in tropical latitudes.
<br>  So the
bottom line is that the horizon mask should be taken as a rough guide
only.  Use Miami if you want more precise info.
<p>
</dd>

<a name="faq1"></a>
<dt> Mauna Kea shows the Sun in Cancer on Aug 3 but Cancer is June 23 â July 22.
</dt>
<dd> It's because of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precession_of_the_equinoxes">precession of the equinoxes<img src="extlink.png"></a> and the inaccuracy of the calendar prior to the Gregorian Reform of 1582.
  Mauna Kea's zodiac dial shows the present astronomical positions of the
 constellations which have changed considerably
 from their positions when the astrological dates were fixed in ancient times.
If you set the date back to about 600 BCE the constellations will be more closely
 aligned with the astrological dates.
<p>
</dd>

<dt> But Mauna Kea doesn't seem to quite match the astronomical constellations, either.
</dt>
<dd> Right.  MK divides the zodiac into twelve equal sections and labels each one with a constellation.
The actual constellations are not all the same size, so MK's labels are only approximate.
The numbers in between each constellation label, however, do accurately indicate
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_coordinate_system">right ascension<img src="extlink.png"></a>
(measured in hours).
Geneva's back side shows the actual constellation boundaries (for the present epoch).
<p>
</dd>

<dt> Will it work on an iPod<span style="font-size:6pt; vertical-align: super">Â®</span> touch?
</dt>
<dd> Versions 1.1 and newer support the iPod touch.  But see
<a href="Settings.html">here</a> for more about setting your time and location correctly.
<p>
</dd>

<dt> Will it work on an iPad<span style="font-size:6pt; vertical-align: super">Â®</span>?
</dt>
<dd> Yes. It will work just as it does on the iPhone, there's no special iPad version (yet).
<p>
</dd>

<dt> It doesn't look quite the same on my iPhone 4 as the pictures on the website.
</dt>
<dd> Right.  There are separate high-resolution graphics for the Retina display.  Here's <a href="TerraRetina.png">an example</a>.
<p>
</dd>

<dt> Will Emerald Chronometer work without an Internet connection (eg. out in the 
wilderness where even cell phone service is unavailable)?
</dt>
<dd>Yes.  Time and location are all that we need;
 all of the astronomy calculations are done
 internally with no Internet required.
See
<a href="Settings.html">here</a> for more about setting your time and location correctly.
<p>
</dd>

<dt>The sunrise/sunset times are wrong on my iPod touch.
</dt>
<dd>You may need to enter your latitude and longitude manually. 
You do this via the Settings panel which is accessed from the "gear" button in the lower right corner of the screen.
  See <a href="Settings.html">here</a> for more details.
<p>
</dd>

<dt> Will it work on a jailbroken iPhone?
</dt>
<dd> Probably not.  We don't support that configuration and we've had reports of odd problems.
<p>
</dd>

<dt> What's all this about "complications"?  What's so complicated about a little calculation?
</dt>
<dd> Well, the calculations are actually pretty complex.  But "complication" is a term of art in the horology (fancy watch) world.  It refers to any watch display other than
hours, minutes, and seconds (or sometimes simple day/date).  See:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(horology)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(horology)<img src="extlink.png"></a><br>
Emerald Chronometer has a very large number of complications; <a href="Complications.html">here's a list</a>.
<p>
</dd>

<a name="faq2"></a>
<dt> The times for moonrise and moonset are not consistent between the various watches.
</dt>
<dd> Emerald Chronometer uses different rules for the "ring"-type displays like Mauna Kea and for the "dial"-type displays like Haleakala:
<p>
The "dial"-type displays use rise and set times for the current day
 (i.e. the day shown in the date windows),
except in cases when the event doesn't happen on  that day in which case it 
just displays 00:00 (this happens a couple times a month for the Moon and 
in summer and winter at high latitudes for the Sun).  The values are updated at midnight.
<p>
On the "ring"-type displays, we use a more complicated algorithm but the result is simpler.
The rings show the closest rise and set time to the current time
 without regard to the day or whether that's before or after the current time.
(In detail: if the Sun is above the horizon then the sunrise indicator shows
the time of the previous sunrise and the sunset indicator shows the next sunset; but if it's nighttime then 
the sunset indicator is shows the time of the last sunset and the sunrise indicator shows the time of the
upcoming sunrise.  The sunrise time is updated at sunset and vice versa.  Similarly for the Moon.) 
<p>
 Since the times of sunrise and sunset change by only a few minutes 
per day the differences between the two rules are small.  But the times of moonrise and moonset change by about an hour each day so the differences are readily apparent.
<p>

</table></center>
<p>
</dd>

<dt> I set Haleakala's time to the exact time of sunrise but the altitude hand is a little below zero.
</dt>
<dd> Yes, that's right.  Sunrise is defined to be the time at which the first bit of the Sun's disk is visible.  But the Sun's altitude is defined as the altitude of the center of the disk.  It takes several minutes for the Sun to move that far.
<p>
</dd>

<dt> I have a real watch that displays the Equation of Time.  It shows a value that's not the same as yours.
</dt>
<dd> We adopt the convention that a positive number means the sundial will show a later time than an ordinary clock.
  IE:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EOT = sundial time - standard time<br>
Some watches use the opposite convention.  Learn more about the Equation of time here:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_time">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_time<img src="extlink.png"></a>
<p>
</dd>

<dt> I leave my iPhone in its dock to charge and love to see my watches all the time.
  But how can I do that without disabling Auto-lock completely?
</dt>
<dd>
Emerald Chronometer has two settings that allow you to disable Auto-lock while it is running: one that applies when the device is plugged in and another that applies when running on battery power.
Be careful with the second one; it can drain the battery in just a few hours.
See <a href="Settings.html">here</a> for more details.
<p>
</dd>

<dt> I set an alarm and quit Emerald Chronometer but when the alarm time came no alarm rang.
This works fine with the builtin Clock and Calendar apps.
</dt>
<dd> In iOS 4 and above, Emerald Chronometer will deliver a local notification in this case.  If your phone can't run that OS because it's too old, there's nothing we can do for you; in older OSs, Apple didn't allow any third party apps to do anything in the background.
<p>
</dd>

<dt> When my alarm goes off when the screen is locked shaking doesn't silence it.
</dt>
<dd> Yes.  Apple disables the accelerometers when the screen is locked.  We  have no control over this.
The alarm will stop when you unlock the screen.
<P>
</dd>

<dt> I set an alarm and left Emerald Chronometer running but when the appointed time arrived in the morning there was no sound.
</dt>
<dd>In some cases with the iPod touch the volume gets reset to zero.
After considerable research one of our customers (using OS 3.1.2 on a new iPod touch) describes it this way:
  "I now suspect a flaw in Apples's software. If Calendar or Mail prefs call for no sound and an event occurs, the apps instruct iPod's master volume to set to zero. Since other apps assume the volume is previously set as the user wishes, no sound is subsequently produced when those apps trigger an event. No doubt the unintended consequence of the new coding necessary to accommodate the physical volume controls....I have been able to confirm that no non-apple alarm clocks function, now. The OS is buggy in the sound department. Forums are full of complaints about all kind of sound issues." 
<P>
</dd>

<dt> When I start up Emerald Chronometer sometimes the hands jump just as the time synchronization indicator turns green.
</dt>
<dd> Yup.  Until we get the first reply from an NTP server we don't really know what the right time is.  It will be stable after that.
<P>
</dd>

<dt> My eyes aren't what the used to be and some of those dials and hands are awfully small.  Can you implement a zoom feature?
</dt>
<dd> Recent iPhone and iPod touch models have a way to do a zoom on any app.  Go to Settings=>General=>Accessibility and click on Zoom.  The zoom gestures are explained on that page.  If you don't find this setting, make sure you have the latest iPhone OS.
<P>
</dd>

<dt> Why is it asking to use my location?
</dt>
<dd>Emerald Chronometer needs to know your location in order to compute various astronomical quantities (eg. sunrise time).  That's all we use it for.  The data is stored on your device only.   We do not transmit it anywhere.  We do not sell it to anyone.  We update it each time the app starts up and about once an hour thereafter.   It will be copied to your computer when you sync with iTunes so you may want to encrypt your backups. 
<p>
</dd>

<dt> Since I bought Emerald Chronometer, I've started getting spam about watches!
</dt>
<dd>
Emerald Sequoia has not ever sold, nor will we ever sell, email addresses of our customers
 or of anyone else who contacts us via email.  We hate spam as much as you do.
<p>
</dd>

<dt> I'd love to have Emerald Chronometer running on an iPod nano, say with a <a href="http://lunatik.com/">TikTok or LunaTik</a> watch band.
</dt>
<dd> We'd love that too!  But unfortunately Apple doesn't allow third-party developers to write apps for the nano; it's not running iOS like the iPhone and iPod touch.
<p> If and when Apple does open up the nano to third-party apps, you can be sure we'll be taking a look....
<p>
</dd>

<dt> It sure would be nice if ...
</dt>
<dd> Don't hesitate to send us enchancement requests or ideas for new watches.
Some of the ideas we've gotten have been really interesting!
We're only a two-person company, so we can't promise if or when any particular request will be implemented.
But the more requests we get from our customers for a particular feature the higher its priority becomes.
Unless we think it's really cool and do it right away.
 <img src="../images/smile.png" alt="smiley" align=center />
<p>
</dd>

<dt> The iPhone isn't designed for the wrist!  How can I get the full experience of actually wearing a fine mechanical timepiece?
</dt>
<dd>If you're desperate, you could try <a href="emeraldwristwatch.html">this</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;But we don't recommend it. <img src="../images/smile.png" alt=":-)" align=center />
<p>
</dd>

<dt> I thought upgrades were free but the App Store seems to have no option other than "Buy Now".
</dt>
<dd> Yes, that's a bit odd.  But it really is free.  Just click the "$4.99" button and the "Buy Now" button and enter your password.  After a bit you'll see a message saying, "You have already purchased this item.  To download it again for free, select OK."
<P>
</dd>

<dt> I tried to upgrade to the latest version and got a message saying I needed to pay again. I thought the upgrades were free?
</dt>
<dd> This is most likely the result of a mix up in your iTunes configuration.
It probably doesn't recognize you as the one who bought the original version, perhaps 
because you  have more than one iTunes account.
<p>
It may also be that the account you used with the App Store app on your iPhone is not the same as the one
you're using with iTunes.  If so, and you don't want to change that,
 then just get the upgrade directly on your iPhone via the App Store application.
<p>
</dd>

<dt> I want my money back  &lt;for whatever reason&gt;
</dt>
<dd>
Unfortunately, Apple does not provide developers like us a way to refund or annul a purchase,
 as far as we've been able to discover.
One thing that may work, though, is to use the iTunes<span style="font-size:6pt; vertical-align: super">Â®</span> store feedback process described at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1933">http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1933<img src="extlink.png"></a>
<br>
One of the great benefits of the way Apple set up the iPhone application distribution system is that developers
don't have to get involved in the billing process.  One of the negatives is that we have no direct way
 to help even if we want to.

Emerald Chronometer<sup>&#0174;</sup> is an iPhoneâ¢ application that models high-end mechanical watches.
These models  contain many of the most complex "complications" found in real watches, plus refinements found nowhere else.  All displays maintain the look and feel of real mechanical objects, but with the time and location accuracy of the iPhone.

<h1>The Physics of Emerald Chronometer</h1>

<center>
<img src='chronos-2.png'/>
</center>
<p>
Emerald Chronometer is designed to be a realistic depiction of a
mechanical watch on an iPhone.  Considerable care has been taken
to avoid displaying things that are physically impossible, to
enhance the illusion that you're looking at a real mechanical time piece.
<p>
For example, the moon phase display on the watch named Chandra (above
right), while considerably more realistic than a typical moon-phase
clock or watch (because it shows the correct shape for all phases),
is implemented with leaves that move to cover the
display rather than simulating a picture.  And the black-and-white
day/night indicators in the watch named Mauna Kea (above left) are
implemented as white ring-segments that rotate into place over the
black background.  If you look closely you can see the faint borders
of these segments move as you press and hold down over the date window
with the crown disengaged (you may need to move the hands out of the way
first).
<p>
You'll see examples of this throughout the application.  Pieces on
watches don't move without some visible means of support, and date wheels
slide into place instead of just flashing to their new number.  The
watches are designed to have the look and feel of something actually mechanical.
<p>
Of course, Emerald Chronometer has no gears behind the covers turning
those wheels and hands.  A real mechanical watch implementing Mauna
Kea would be on par with, if not more complicated than, the most
complicated watches available today.  Real mechanical watch designers
live in a much different world, and the authors of Emerald Chronometer
have great respect for the miracles they are able to accomplish with
microscopic mechanical parts.  Further, Emerald Chronometer has access
to two things mechanical watches don't, an accurate time source (atomic clocks
via the Internet) and accurate location data (from the iPhone's
Location Services).
<p>
So Emerald Chronometer is somewhat of a hybrid: a simulation of a
mechanical machine which, under the covers, does a bit of the
impossible.  It's a magic trick in reverse, if you will, where the
bit that seems impossible is behind the curtain instead of in front
of it.  The authors hope you enjoy the effect.

<b>Los Gatos, California, December 28, 2009</b>. &nbsp;<a href="http://emeraldsequoia.com/">Emerald Sequoia LLC</a>&nbsp;today released&nbsp;<a href="http://emeraldsequoia.com/eg/index.html">Emerald Geneva</a>, a Lite version of its critically acclaimed Emerald Chronometer iPhone app, following closely an update of Emerald Chronometer to version 3.0. &nbsp;Both apps model a running mechanical watch, with very fine precision and an emphasis on astronomical complications. &nbsp;Emerald Chronometer was Apple app of the week &nbsp;in July 2008, an Apple "Staff Favorite" in December 2008, and was rated the BEST clock app at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.appreview.com/applications/3191">appreview.com</a>. &nbsp;Both apps are available now at the app store (<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/emerald-geneva/id347828665?mt=8">Emerald Geneva</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/emerald-chronometer/id284953670?mt=8">Emerald Chronometer</a>).

<h2>&nbsp;<h2>
<h3>Emerald Geneva</h3>
<center><img alt="Emerald Chronometer Geneva" width="640" height="460" src="Geneva-1.png"></center>
<p>
Emerald Geneva, with an introductory price of $0.99 in the US, models the watch Geneva, designed by Emerald Sequoia LLC, which is the most complicated of the 14 watches shipped with Emerald Chronometer. &nbsp;Geneva has the following features:<br>
 - NTP (atomic time) synchronization<br>
 - Sunrise/sunset and moonrise/moonset dials<br>
 - Moonphase<br>
 - Perpetual calendar<br>
 - Eclipse predictor<br>
 - Ability to quickly set watch to any date from 4000 BCE to 2800 CE<br>
 - Location setting with four ways of setting location and timezone<br>
 - Zodiac constellations<br>
 - Lunar node indicators<br>
 - Sidereal time<br>
 - Precession of the equinoxes<br>
 - Right ascension of Sun and Moon
<p>

<h2>&nbsp;<h2>
<h3>Emerald Chronometer 3.0</h3>
<center><img alt="Emerald Chronometer Firenze" width="640" height="460" src="Firenze-1.png"></center>
<p>
Emerald Chronometer includes Geneva and 13 other watches, and has been available since the App Store opened in July 2008. &nbsp;Version 3.0 of Emerald Chronometer, released earlier this month, adds displays for the positions of the 6 inner planets (through Saturn), a new grid mode that shows multiple watches running simultaneously, and a sophisticated location-setting system with four ways of setting your location and timezone. &nbsp;The image above shows just one of the new watches (out of a total of 14 now included).
<p>
The help system describing all of these watches has been described by a reviewer as the best Help system available for any app. &nbsp;A copy of that help system, which also includes a 5-minute demo movie just scratching the surface of the functionality, can be found at&nbsp;<a href="http://emeraldsequoia.com/h/index.html">the Emerald Chronometer web page</a>

  <span style='text-align:right' class='smallest'>(click for full size image)</span></a></center>
<p>
In addition to ordinary time and date, Emerald Observatory displays a wealth of astronomical information all on one screen, in a unique but understandable format.  Information includes:<br>
- Times of rise and set for the Sun, the Moon, and the 5 classical planets<br>
- Times of the beginning and ending of twilight<br>
- Heliocentric orrery (display of the planets in orbit around the Sun)<br>
- Altitude and azimuth for the same bodies (one body at a time)<br>
- Current phase and relative apparent size of the moon<br>
- Current regions of day and night on a world map<br>
- The Equation of Time, solar time, UTC time, and sidereal time<br>
- Month, day, year, and leap-year indicator<br>
- Displayed times are synchronized via NTP to "atomic clock" standard<br>
- Uses iPad location, or the latitude and longitude may be set manually<br>
- Option to force the display to stay on continuously
<p>
The time can be set to any date from 4000 BCE to 2800 CE.  The clock can be animated at high rates to more easily see the changes in long term astronomical variables such as the seasons and moon phases.  A detailed description manual for the operation of Emerald Observatory can be found at the Emerald Sequoia LLC web site at <a href="http://emeraldsequoia.com/eo/">http://emeraldsequoia.com/eo/</a>.  Emerald Observatory is priced at just $0.99 and is available now at Apple's App Store <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/emerald-observatory-for-ipad/id364904759?mt=8">here</a>.

<h1>Moving Events From One Device To Another</h1>
<p>

<em>Please note:  Emerald Sequoia LLC does not endorse or support the following procedure.  We offer it as a possibility for those customers who really want existing events on a different device, and who no longer need events that may have already been captured on that other device (merging is not possible).</em>
<p>
There is no supported way to move events from one device to another.  However, some people have had success using a 3rd-party program (not affiliated with Emerald Sequoia LLC) called PhoneDisk for the Mac.  Please use this procedure at your own risk, and follow the suggestions to back up your devices and your data before starting.  <em>And please note that existing events on the destination device will be lost!!!</em>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure Emerald Timestamp is installed on both devices.</li>
<li>Back up both devices using iTunes.</li>
<li>Use Emerald Timestamp on each device to email yourself a copy of all events, so you have them in some format in case something goes wrong.</li>
<li>Obtain a copy of the Mac program Phone Disk, and install it on your Mac.  At this writing, it can be found at <a href="http://www.macroplant.com">http://www.macroplant.com</a> <em>(Note again, this is not our product)</em>.</li>
<li>If the destination device is running iOS 4.0 or later, reboot it (this will ensure that Timestamp is not running in the background and thus will not collide with the changes we will be making).</li>
<li>Connect the device containing the events to be moved to the Mac.</li>
<li>Wait a minute or so for Phone Disk to recognize it, then from the Phone Disk menu, select the device name, and then "Change Connection Root" => "Timestamp".</li>
<li>If Phone Disk is working properly, it should mount a virtual disk on your Mac with the name of your device.  Navigate there; you should see several subfolders, including "Library" and "Documents".</li>
<li>Navigate to Library => Preferences.  You should see a file called "com.emeraldsequoia.Timestamp.plist".  Copy that file somewhere on your Mac.</li>
<li>Now connect your second device to the Mac (the one you want to copy the Timestamp events to).</li>
<li>From the Phone Disk menu, select the second device name, and then "Change Connection Root" => "Timestamp". (If Timestamp is not there, ensure you've installed Timestamp on the device, and then retry).</li>
<li>A new virtual disk should show up on your Mac with the name of your second device.</li>
<li>On that new virtual disk, navigate to Library/Preferences.  Again you should see the file "com.emeraldsequoia.Timestamp.plist".  You'll be replacing this file with the one you copied from the other device; you may want to copy the existing one somewhere on your Mac first (note:  It is not possible to merge two event lists; any existing events on this device will be lost!).</li>
<li>Copy the other device's file from where you copied it in step 9 into the new virtual disk's Library/Preferences folder.</li>
<li>Now start Timestamp on the new device.  You should see the same events that are shown on the old device.  Again, your existing events on the new device will be lost.</li>
</ol>

<p>

<b>Emerald Timestamp</b> lets you capture the precise times of events, and associate a description with each one.  It's a universal app which runs at full resolution on the iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch.
<p>
Press the large button with the arrows pointing down to record the current time value.  It will show up at the top of the list below.  Add as many as you like; the list scrolls.
<p>
To add a one-line description, tap an event in the list and enter the description on the detail page (see below).
<p>
Tap the date or time at the top of either screen to change the format of the time displays.  Each tap cycles between 12-hour local, 24-hour local, UTC (aka GMT), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_day">Julian Date</a> (an astronomical time reference; see below), and "interval" times (see below).  You can choose a subset of these time formats to be cycled through using the Options panel (see below).
<p>
To find the difference in times between events, switch to "interval" display (see above) and then tap the "zero" button on an event in the list, and other times will be measured against that zero reference. Equivalently, press the "Use as reference zero" button on the detail page for an event.  The behavior is different depending on whether the option "Allow multiple interval zeroes" is turned on (see below):
<ul>
<li>If off (the default), then a single reference zero is used for all events, and events prior to the designated zero are displayed with negative interval times.
<li>If on, then intervals are always measured forward from the previous zero, and the first (oldest) event is always a zero event.
</ul>
To go back to absolute times, tap the main time display at the top until your desired time base is displayed.
<p>
Options (Settings) are available via the Options button at the bottom center.  On the Options screens you can
<ul>
<li>Create custom event-capture buttons, which preload the captured event with a string you can define (the string also appears as the button title)
<li>Disable the device's Auto-Lock function so that it won't lock the screen while you're waiting for an event to occur
<li>Disable the button click sound
<li>Select which time formats are included in the cycle when tapping on a date or time.  Note that there are two Julian Date (JD) formats, depending on whether the JD displays are referenced to UTC or to TT.  The latter is preferred for astronomical measurements (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_day">Wikipedia</a>) but the default is UTC to be consistent with older versions of Emerald Timestamp.  Each timestamp indicates the current global setting (i.e., "JD (UTC)" or "JD (TT)").
<li>Select the threshold of error bound which results in green buttons and events (see below)
<li>Specify that email should be sent with tab separated values (TSV) instead of plain text
<li>Limit the number of days and events sent when emailing "All events".
<li>Specify that there can be multiple zero points for intervals.
</ul>
<p>
<p>
The iPhone's internal clock can be somewhat unreliable.  So when <b>Emerald Timestamp</b> starts up (and every time it is awakened after the device has been locked) it uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol">NTP</a> to synchronize its own clock with the international standard atomic clocks.  This process requires network access and can take several seconds.  Until it is done the accuracy of event timing is somewhat uncertain.  During that uncertain time, <b>Emerald Timestamp</b>'s big button is yellow.  When the sync is complete, the button turns green and event timing is very accurate.
<p>
Emerald Timestamp uses location services to determine the best time servers to contact.  Time servers that are in the same country will generally result in faster round-trip times and thus better accuracy and faster synchronization.
<p>
You can record events even when the button is yellow.
If a sync is completed before the app is shut down or the device is locked, then the sync will be applied retroactively to all events captured since the last startup or unlock
(and the displayed time values for such events may change as a result).
The green/yellow indicator light to the left of each event indicates its time accuracy.
<p>
Tapping an event in the list brings up a page showing more detail about that event.
You can add a one-line description by tapping the "Event description" field.
You can email this event's details or the details of all the events.
<p>
The detail page also shows an accuracy bound for the time of the event.  The accuracy of synchronized events is primarily constrained by the length of time it takes for a round trip from the device to the NTP server and back; server times are usually much more accurate than that round-trip time.  Emerald Timestamp reports the accuracy based on that round-trip time, refined by a number of request-report cycles, and including an estimate of the server error based on its own reported parameters.
<p>
A synchronization is considered "green" by default if its reported accuracy is less than 0.40 seconds; this threshold may be set in Settings (see above).  In "interval" mode (see above) both events must have an accuracy less than the specified accuracy for the interval to be green; the detail page reports the actual combined accuracy (which may not be larger than an individual event's accuracy if the app session was running continuously between the two events).  Regardless of the threshold chosen, Emerald Timestamp continues to refine the synchronization until the error is no more than 0.16 seconds, or until it times out trying (after a minute or two).
<p>
At the top right of the main screen is an indicator of the current accuracy bound.  It's gray while synchronizing, and white at other times.  Tap it to force another synchronization.
<p>
Press the Edit button in the lower right to remove one or more events from the list.  The button at the lower left starts out as "Delete All", which will remove all events at once; or you can tap individual events to select them and then tap the lower-left button, which will be labeled "Delete (n)" where n is the number of events that will be deleted.
<p>
This version of Emerald Timestamp has tentative support for live leap-second display.  See <a href="leapSecond.html">this page</a> for details.

<h1>Support for Leap Seconds in Emerald Timestamp</h1>
<p>
Beginning with version 2.0, Emerald Timestamp has tentative support for live leap-second display.  That is, during the insertion of the leap second at the end of June 2012 (UTC), the UTC time read, for example,<br>
23:59:59.9 UTC<br>
23:59:60.0 UTC<br>
23:59:60.1 UTC<br>
23:59:60.2 UTC<br>
...<p>
You can see a movie of Emerald Time and Emerald Timestamp taken during the leap second in June 2012 <a href="../movies/Leap-Second/Leap_Second_ET_ETS.html">here</a>.
<p>
A few notes about this support:
<ul>
<li>Intervals that span a leap-second event are properly calculated.
<li>NTP servers in the past have not been consistent in returning the correct time after a leap-second event, so the time may revert (or partially revert) when the first sync comes in following the event.  It will eventually catch back up to the official time as the NTP servers correct themselves properly, so this will only affect times captured during the period immediately after the leap-second event.
<li>JD(UTC) will "hold" at the leap-second boundary, because it has no way of representing the intervening time.  This is why JD(TT) is recommended to be used in its place, though of course it is referenced to a different standard.
<li>Similarly, Excel has no way of representing the extra time, so when exporting to an Excel spreadsheet the times like :60.x are represented as being at :00.0 for the next minute.  Excel-format intervals are correctly exported.
</ul>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<dl>

<dt> Sometimes my device locks even though "Disable auto-lock" is set for that configuration.
</dt>
<dd> This is a known issue with the mechanism used by Emerald Timestamp to disable auto locking; sometimes the device fails to honor the request.  We have strong evidence that this is an Apple OS problem and have submitted a bug report to Apple.
<p>
</dd>

<dt> Will it work on an iPhoneâ¢ or iPod<span style="font-size:6pt; vertical-align: super">Â®</span> touch or iPadâ¢?
</dt>
<dd> Yes.  Emerald Timestamp is a "universal" app.  Buy it once and it will run on all your iPhone OS devices, at full resolution.
<p>
</dd>

<dt> Will it work on a Mac or a PC or any other smart phone?
</dt>
<dd> No.
<p>
</dd>

<dt> Will Emerald Timestamp work without an Internet connection?
</dt>
<dd>Yes. But the accuracy of the times cannot be guaranteed.
<p>
</dd>

<dt> When the button goes from yellow to green sometimes the time values change.
</dt>
<dd>The time of the event didn't change.  What changed is Emerald Timestamps's clock against which the event times are measured.  The new time is more accurate.
<P>
</dd>

<dt> What's does JD mean?
</dt>
<dd>"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_day">Julian Date</a>".  It's for astronomers.
<p>
</dd>
