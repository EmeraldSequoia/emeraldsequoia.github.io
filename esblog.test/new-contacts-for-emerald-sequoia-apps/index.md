# New contacts for Emerald Sequoia apps
**2024-09-04**

---

As we will be shutting down our ES support email, we have designated official locations to contact for support with the apps. There is a small group of volunteer developers who have expressed interest in keeping the products below going, but all have constraints on their time so there is no guarantee of continued support.

For each of the three products, I've listed two links. The first is to report a bug or to track existing bugs. Remember that the number of people here is small and they are all volunteers, so they may not respond right away (or at all). The second link is a specific "Issue" where you can express interest in helping out with the development itself by commenting on the Issue with your interest.

Would you consider selling g the intellectual property to another developer willing to support it ?
