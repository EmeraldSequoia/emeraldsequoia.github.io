# Eclipse today for non-US users
**2011-06-15**

---

Just a quick note that there is a total lunar eclipse today: [http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/LEdecade/LEdecade2011.html](http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/LEdecade/LEdecade2011.html)  
[http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/LEplot/LEplot2001/LE2011Jun15T.pdf](http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/LEplot/LEplot2001/LE2011Jun15T.pdf)

It's the longest and deepest lunar eclipse of the decade, but unfortunately most of our customers will miss it because the moon will be below the horizon. You'll be able to see a bit of the ends in Europe and Australia, but only India and eastern Africa (and a bit of central Asia) will get the whole show.

You can still see the effects in Emerald Observatory and Emerald Chronometer/Emerald Geneva (the back of the Geneva watch has an eclipse indicator dial), even if the eclipse isn't visible at your location.

I love Emerald Observatory. My husband came home an astronomy meeting where the guest lecturer discussed to tell me about it and five minutes later I had it on my Ipad. Almost every night for over a year I opened that to see what up in the sky and to study the information I find on it. I recently kicked myself when I forgot about the eclipse simulator and missed a wonderful opportunity to see how that works. Now that I carry an Iphone, I'd love to see Observatory on that device, too, since I almost always have it with me where my Ipad is often too bulky. Please tell me you'll update Observatory for the Iphone or even make an separate app for Iphone.

My husband also wants you to develop Chronometer and Observatory for his android device.
