<b>Los Gatos, California, May 4, 2018</b>.&nbsp;<a href="http://emeraldsequoia.com/">Emerald Sequoia LLC</a> today announced <a href="http://emeraldsequoia.com/aw/index.html">Emerald Chronometer for Wear OS by Google</a>, a wearable version of its highly-rated Emerald Chronometer apps for <a href="http://emeraldsequoia.com/h/index.html">iPhone</a> and <a href="http://emeraldsequoia.com/h/echd.html">iPad</a>.

<p>
  Emerald Chronometer for Wear OS contains 21 faces (available separately or as a bundle for half price), with an emphasis on beautiful, highly-acccurate  mechanical simulations, primarily of astronomical functions and world time.  With one exception (an old watch face belonging to one of the founders' ancestors), all of the watch faces were designed in-house.

<p>
  The port to Wear OS took a number of years of part-time work as nearly everything needed to change: The platform moved from phone to watch, the langugage moved from Objective C to C++ and Java, and the OS moved from iOS to Android. But the result is that the same highly-efficient engine designed for the original iPhone is now running on a device that you can wear on your wrist!
