<b>Los Gatos, California, December 28, 2009</b>. &nbsp;<a href="http://emeraldsequoia.com/">Emerald Sequoia LLC</a>&nbsp;today released&nbsp;<a href="http://emeraldsequoia.com/eg/index.html">Emerald Geneva</a>, a Lite version of its critically acclaimed Emerald Chronometer iPhone app, following closely an update of Emerald Chronometer to version 3.0. &nbsp;Both apps model a running mechanical watch, with very fine precision and an emphasis on astronomical complications. &nbsp;Emerald Chronometer was Apple app of the week &nbsp;in July 2008, an Apple "Staff Favorite" in December 2008, and was rated the BEST clock app at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.appreview.com/applications/3191">appreview.com</a>. &nbsp;Both apps are available now at the app store (<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/emerald-geneva/id347828665?mt=8">Emerald Geneva</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/emerald-chronometer/id284953670?mt=8">Emerald Chronometer</a>).

<p>
Emerald Chronometer includes Geneva and 13 other watches, and has been available since the App Store opened in July 2008. &nbsp;Version 3.0 of Emerald Chronometer, released earlier this month, adds displays for the positions of the 6 inner planets (through Saturn), a new grid mode that shows multiple watches running simultaneously, and a sophisticated location-setting system with four ways of setting your location and timezone. &nbsp;The image above shows just one of the new watches (out of a total of 14 now included).
<p>
The help system describing all of these watches has been described by a reviewer as the best Help system available for any app. &nbsp;A copy of that help system, which also includes a 5-minute demo movie just scratching the surface of the functionality, can be found at&nbsp;<a href="http://emeraldsequoia.com/h/index.html">the Emerald Chronometer web page</a>
